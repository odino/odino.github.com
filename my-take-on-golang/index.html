<p>For the past six months (right after the <a href="http://europe.dockercon.com/">DockerCon</a>)
I have been constantly taking some time out to play
around with <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, trying
to understand why a lot of new tools were being
written in this interesting language, especially
in the DevOps world.</p>

<p>In the last few days <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/">we</a>
published our first open source
library written in go, <a href="https://github.com/namshi/godo">godo</a>,
and I wanted to share my impression
of the language and the platform.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have no solid experience in Go and you
should understand that I come from a scripting
background, starting from PHP all the way to
JavaScript, 2 languages I both love &amp; hate
depending on the day :)</p>

<p>Even though my experience comes from 2 languages
and platforms that have been <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">highly</a> <a href="http://www.boronine.com/2012/12/14/Why-JavaScript-Still-Sucks/">criticized</a>
over the past years, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun
trying to preach towards the adoption of of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/">PEAA</a>,
automated testing<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> and good abstraction,
so I&rsquo;ve seen both the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/110797/why-is-php-so-frequently-used-on-web-servers">simplistic / simple</a> and the
<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-ridiculous-Java-class-names-from-real-code">complex / structured</a>, which is why I always tend
to play around with new tools and platforms: <strong>one
more try, one more point of view</strong>.</p>

<p>So, here starts the fun&hellip;</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>So, it all started on my way back from Amsterdam
(where DockerCon 2014 was held), I typed <code>mkdir holland</code>
(what else?) and followed an advice <a href="http://www.matteocollina.com/#biography">a friend of mine</a>
gave me, which was &ldquo;<em>Golang is really good with concurrency,
[&hellip;] go ahead and write your next proxy with it</em>&rdquo;:
let&rsquo;s write a proxy then!</p>

<p>The first natural thing was to then write a simple
Dockerfile starting with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>FROM golang
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>MAINTAINER Alessandro Nadalin "alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>RUN go get github.com/codegangsta/gin
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>5 minutes and I was ready to play with Golang on my
machine, writing my first &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; copying
the sample code from <code>golang.org</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: it was fairly easy to setup
everything on my system, but this is more thanks to
Docker rather than Go itself.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The next step was to try to find documentation
on how to do the simplest tasks with Go, just like I
did when I first started learning PHP 7 years ago and
JS a few full-moons ago.</p>

<p>To be honest, the experience wasn&rsquo;t pleasant, at least at first:
there aren&rsquo;t as many tutorial guiding through your first
steps with Go and, obviously, I was finding myself in trouble
even to simply declare my own packages and understanding
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gopath">how the gopath works</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was able to figure these basic things out
quite quickly, but not quick enough to avoid getting my
wifi being cut off as I was getting on a plane to get back
to Dubai; at that point, the greatest of all surprises:
<code>godoc -http=:6060</code>. Pure magic.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/godoc.png"></p>

<p>Yes, you can basically browse the whole golang.org website
offline, which gave me a huge boost even though I was
on a plane, without internet connection<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: what I still find hard is to be
able to rely on a plethora of online tutorials on how to
do some stuff (ie. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=golang+ssh+gateway+host">SSHing from Go through a gateway</a>),
but you can live with it. The offline documentation is
really great and, on a broader level, the whole Golang
community is making a great effort to give newcomers a
clue.</p>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>One of the I was worried about is that Go is compiled,
though it&rsquo;s also one of its biggest strenghts.</p>

<p>The <em>meh</em> feeling you get once you hear that something is
compiled, coming from a scripting environment, is that
all of that jazz adds overhead, dead moments that
get you out of the zone and so on; luckily, Golang was born
at Google which means that it was designed to scale, both
in production and during development, else imagine how many
man days would be lost in a place like Google, who can
count on <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-many-software-engineers-does-Google-have">~10k engineers</a><sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, you can compile the entire Go source
in <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-Rust-and-Go-compare-1/answer/Carmi-Grushko">8 seconds</a>,
which gives you a fair idea. Your own software, which will
probably use 5% of those dependencies, will probably take
less than 300ms, which is pretty <strong>ideal</strong>.</p>

<p>In JS I would develop much different applications,
but if I have to think of how long I wait between editing a file
in an angular app and being able to see the changes on the browser,
I think it might be around the same time.
This is not to compare JS and Go (how silly would that be?) but it&rsquo;s
more to highlight the fact that if you&rsquo;ve already worked on frontend,
the average Go program won&rsquo;t dramatically change your habits,
at least from a development workflow perspective.</p>

<p>And then, <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/83780/how-fast-can-go-go">Go is fast</a>. How fast?
You don&rsquo;t really care, because your typical use case won&rsquo;t stress
Go that much, but expect it to perform <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2r1ybd/speed_of_go_compared_to_java_and_python/">significantly better
than scripted stuff like Python or Node</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it always depends on <strong>your application</strong>, <strong>your need</strong> and
<strong>your coding skills</strong> &mdash; at the end of the day I can only point
obvious truths out, and the fact that something compiled performs
better than something interpreted isn&rsquo;t groundbreaking news :)</p>

<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t particularly like is that whenever I comment
some code, I find that the source hasn&rsquo;t been compiled because</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>src/exec/exec.go:8: imported and not used: "sync"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which means that I just commented some code that relied on an
external package and now, since that code is not used anymore,
the compiler warns me that &ldquo;<em>hey, why are you importing a useless package?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can live with this kind of stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: pretty solid. I love the fact that whatever
I write can be run on Windows without too much of a hassle, that
it produces a binary that <strong>just works</strong> and that you don&rsquo;t have
to worry about too many things. The transition, in terms of paradigm,
was pretty straightforward.</p>

<h2>Standard library</h2>

<p>Go&rsquo;s standard library is rock-solid and quite vast:
give a look at the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/">list of packages</a> and you&rsquo;ll get
an idea.</p>

<p>The way the <code>godoc</code> commands presents packages, by the way, is
pretty good: you will see the docblocks for every package / function,
along with the annotated source:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/go-source.png"></p>

<p>Overall, I feel someone&rsquo;s got my back when I have a problem:
you will usually find some package or small utility function
that will solve your problem or provide inspiration for your own
use case.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: I think there is still a lot that can
be abstracted and put in Go&rsquo;s standard library, but the general
feeling I have is that&rsquo;s already very good. Sometimes I miss the
(3rd party) modularity that comes with JavaScript, but there are
a lot of <a href="http://go-search.org/">external packages</a> for Go as well.</p>

<h2>Generics</h2>

<p>This has been reported to me by more than one person, and I never understood
it until I actually had to face the &ldquo;problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Go&rsquo;s <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#generics">lack of generics</a> irritates
a few people, though I can ensure you can live without them without
having to worry too much.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>consider not having generics a feature</strong>: you need to
live without them and design software in a way that doesn&rsquo;t allow
room for generics or, in other words, ambiguity.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: it is probably true that generics add flexibility
to your development experience, but like the golang&rsquo;s website says, they
&ldquo;<em>add complexity and extra cost in the type system and run-time</em>&rdquo;, so you&rsquo;ll
have to learn to live without them. I am ok with it.</p>

<h2>go fmt ./&hellip;</h2>

<p>I wont waste too much time on this, but let&rsquo;s just say that, in
my opinion, we should have something like go&rsquo;s fmt in every single
programming platform.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/go-fmt.png"></p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: A W E S O M E ++</p>

<h2>Wonkiness</h2>

<p>There are other small weird things that make Go look
wonky at first, ie. function visibility:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">mypackage</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// protected</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">doSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// public</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These sort of things might seem counter-intuitive,
but at the end of the day they all contribute to a
more coincise syntax<sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> and a more pragmatic
way of programming.</p>

<p><strong>Overall experience</strong>: I would say Go&rsquo;s wonky enough :)
I don&rsquo;t like the syntax very much, but it&rsquo;s not like
I was coming straight out of the 7th heaven, being used
to JS and PHP. At the end of the day it&rsquo;s coincise and
decent enough that I feel pretty ok about it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m very happy of my experiment and I hope I&rsquo;ll be able
to play more with Go, as it seems to fill some gaps where
other programming languages / platforms aren&rsquo;t great at. I believe that
the overall development experience is quite nice and the
language is pretty easy to pick up, granted you have
a couple years of experience with software development in general.</p>

<p>Last but not least, lately I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://odino.org/5-technologies-you-should-keep-an-eye-on-in-2015/">so many DevOps tools
being built with Golang</a>, and I can finally say
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/godo">we joined the party</a> :)</p>
