<h2>Websockets to the rescue</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a>
quite a while ago but I honestly never found a practical application for our
architecture: nonetheless, in one of the talks it was <a href="http://blog.arungupta.me/2014/02/rest-vs-websocket-comparison-benchmarks/">compared to REST</a>
in a context where multiple API calls are made, and the idea of re-using the same
TCP connection is pretty handy at that point.</p>

<p>For sure, things like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12103628/spdy-as-replacement-for-websockets">SPDY</a>
are probably already enough from that point of view, but that&rsquo;s not a valid excuse
for not digging deeper into the WS specification.</p>

<h2>Patterns of batch processing</h2>

<p>During the same talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/arungupta">Arun Gupta</a> spoke about
<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/batch_applications_in_java_ee">JSR 352</a>,
a specification for batch processing introduced in Java EE7.</p>

<p>It was really interesting as the specification is quite &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; but anyhow
efficient, as it structures batch jobs following a few rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>every job must process a specific number of items to process</li>
<li>it is divided in steps</li>
<li>each step is then again divided into 3 different sub-steps

<ul>
<li>reading the content of the item (<code>ItemReader</code>)</li>
<li>processing it, executing transformation and any kind of magic over that content (<code>ItemProcessor</code>)</li>
<li>writing the processed content <em>somewhere</em> (<code>ItemWriter</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Dividing batches into jobs of a limited number of items is a golden rule (and I would say
your number should be as close to 1 as possible), while the structure that the JSR proposes
is very clean.</p>

<h2>Xamarin</h2>

<p>This tool might be what you were looking for if you&rsquo;re into mobile development:
its aim is to write code once (in C#) that gets <strong>converted to native code</strong> for both
IOS and Android.</p>

<p>If you had to write an app twice, because you needed to go native, you might really
wanna <a href="https://xamarin.com/">have a look at it</a> as, from what I heard, it might
really simplify your life.</p>

<h2>AppDynamics</h2>

<p>My bad for not being aware of <a href="http://www.appdynamics.com/">AppDynamics</a>, but we&rsquo;re pretty
happy with one of their competitors (<a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a>) :)</p>

<p>AD is an <strong>application performance management</strong> platform that, just like NR, provides agents for
various platforms in order to collect metrics and reports from the stuff that runs on your
production servers: definitely worth a look, at least to understand the differences between
these guys and NewRelic.</p>

<h2>Detach DOM elements while transforming them</h2>

<p>Switching to something more browser-oriented, I found out about a very simple but
effective tecnique to optimize browser rendering performances when working with DOM
elements: instead of applying a bunch of transformations on a visible element you can
simply hide it, apply them and then show the element again, so that the browser
won&rsquo;t have to repaint and reflow at every transformation but only when you eventually
make the element visible again.</p>

<p>Another way to implement the same tecnique is to clone the element (so that we are actually
just working with a <strong>virtual DOM node</strong>), apply the transformations to that element and then
replacing the existing one by calling <code>parent.innerHtml(virtualElement)</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty simple but much valuable!</p>

<h2>Optimize DOM animations</h2>

<p>Another way to optimize browser performance upon rendering is to execute animations
on elements with an absolute or fixed position.</p>

<p>Why? Again, because then the browser doesn&rsquo;t have to reflow the whole DOM.</p>

<h2>Lodash</h2>

<p>A very <a href="http://lodash.com/">handy JS library</a> that seems to be <a href="http://lodash.com/benchmarks">way faster</a>
than underscore. It is now considered a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13789618/differences-between-lodash-and-underscore">superset of underscore</a>
and you might want to look into using it from now on, in place of its predecessor.</p>

<h2>All in all&hellip;</h2>

<p>It was a fairly good day and my <a href="/orientdb-the-fastest-document-based-graph-database/">presentation about OrientDB</a>
went pretty well, can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow!</p>
