<h2>The Agile rape</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/televangelist.jpg"></p>

<p>We hear the word <em>Agile</em> everywhere, thanks to the fact that
this is a concept 10 years old, brought to the public by some
of the <strong>greatest minds in computer engineering</strong>, who could also
describe <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420">interesting things</a>
other than a cool way to have more fun and be more productive at work.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: the word &ldquo;<em>Agile</em>&rdquo;&ldquo; has been raped over the past
5 years.
This is not because it became mainstream and everyone
wanted to adopt it, it&rsquo;s because once it was about to
become mainstream a lot of people heard of it and
wanted to integrate <strong>their own</strong> vision of agile
development into their IT infrastructures.</p>

<p>You read it: <strong>their</strong> own vision.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">lean software development</a>: we have
the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Poppendieck/e/B001IGNU3O/">Poppendieck saga</a>
and not much more; sure, there are a lot of books and a
lot of opinions about LSD across IT professionals,
nonetheless everyone takes inspiration from the infamous
<em>weds</em>, not from what they heard about what they wrote.</p>

<p>Fact, this is the reason why LSD is still a pure oasis
in IT<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>SCRUM</h2>

<p>Sure, one of the things I&rsquo;d point my finger against is SCRUM.</p>

<p>This lightweight agile methodolgy is probably on everyone&rsquo;s
mouth since 3 years, since lot of people adopted it and
it seem to work: nonetheless, SCRUM is failing and will continue failing
in preserving and communicating the legacy of the agile
principles, values and patterns.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/rugby-scrum.jpg"></p>

<p>The problem with SCRUM is not SCRUM itself, because I
think it <em>may</em> work in some contexts, but to the way
people interpret it and implement it in their own
processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the focus is shifted from the IT team and the transparency
betweem the <strong>whole team</strong> to the <em>product owner</em>, which acts
as a benevolent dictator between the team and the customer</li>
<li>whenever you add a layer between programmers and the
customer, you introduce an overhead, which means a less efficient
communication</li>
<li>SCRUM masters often fail to facilitate, since they become
a bottleneck in the process: if a problem depends to the SM,
N people in the development team have to rely and wait for him,
while, if the team act as a standalone being, each part of it
can theoretically deal with problems applying a FIFO
principle (<em>first in, first out</em>, sorting problems by priority
and business value rather than age)</li>
<li>1 out of 2 <strong>certified SCRUM masters</strong> that I meet don&rsquo;t
even know how to finish <em>&ldquo;Individuals and interactions&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
which I find first offensive second really frustrating</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, the last one is a merely pure personal observation:
still, there&rsquo;s no doubt about the certification itself,
which I find pretty overestimated.</p>

<p>[Formally] <strong>Certifying processes that don&rsquo;t have formal
approaches</strong> is purely counter-intuitive: sorry, agile
processes are not formal<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>All in all the history of SCRUM and its adopters teaches
us that a few big corporations are willing to make a step
and try to embrace agile development, with the wrong approach:
if you will to adopt something that &ndash; oh, boy! &ndash; has a
manifesto you should, in first place, try not to betray
its values, <strong>transparency at first place</strong>.</p>

<h2>We are different</h2>

<p>The reality is that I never heard stories from the trenches of
an agile organization: ok, I read them, ok, I heard
something, but I never spoke with someone who illustrated
me a 100% adoption of one agile methodology,
no matter if SCRUM, crystal or XP<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I still think that embracing agile is the winning
option, (almost) no matter when and where:
share with me your stories, I&rsquo;d be glad to
give them some space here.</p>

<p>Still, agile&rsquo;s biggest problems are both
management and programmers: the management always
has a skeptical eye on new methodologies that
make their teams slower<sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> and
programmers often think that they should interpret
their own view of agile development.</p>

<p>Just a mention: I worked several months for a firm
who was selling itself as &ldquo;agile&rdquo; or &ndash; at least &ndash;
&ldquo;agile-prone&rdquo;, while no one ever did a retrospective
<strong>in months</strong>.</p>

<p>I spoke with PMs, I spoke with the CTO, I spoke with
the programmers: everyone had good intentions but no
one was <strong>eager to be the change</strong>, not to <strong>just talk</strong>.</p>

<p>Back then, it was really frustrating: so no surprise I
parted ways with that organization while account
managers are still there, working every day until 9pm
because &ldquo;<em>in this industry it works like this</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.agiledevelopment.it/2012/01/we-are-different/">We are different</a>&rdquo;,
they said.</p>

<h2>An agile and slower IT would just be a pain for our business</h2>

<p>IT is a bottleneck, <strong>get over it</strong>.</p>

<p>Still, most organizations think that the problem between their
ideas and their success is IT, since it tends to slow down and
raise doubts about estimates, delivery times and implementations.</p>

<p>Now, put things this way: you have a great idea, you
know it&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>

<p>Sadly, having an idea and implementing it are different things:
in a case, you think it and it becomes real, in the other
you need to work hard and in a very qualitative way not to
limit and ruin the motivation behind your work &ndash; guess
if IT fits in the first or the second case.</p>

<p>Still, <strong>IT is a bottleneck</strong>.</p>

<p>Be fine with it, that&rsquo;s why technicians tend to limit/screw
your ideas: they try to bring you back to reality and suggest
the most credibile solutions to your problems.
They have to be the bottleneck between a management&rsquo;s
childish dreams and reality.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/bottleneck.jpg"></p>

<p>Still, <strong>agile is a bottleneck</strong>.</p>

<p>Be fine with it, that&rsquo;s why agilists tend to enpower
collaboration: they try to find the best mid-term
solution for your problem, to help your business not
facing IT bottlenecks in <em>put-some-number-here</em> months.
They have to be the bottleneck between a management&rsquo;s
lack of knowledge and technology.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the management should listen to its IT
department and get some genuine advices about their
digital strategy and the upcoming issues that technology
could reserve them ( read &ldquo;it&rsquo;s stupid to spend 600k on
facebook ads for a mini-site if you dont have the right
servers to handle the groundbreaking traffic which
will come from ads themselves&rdquo; ).</p>

<p>I once worked in a company where the CEO thought we could
do whatever technologic project people would have
asked for: the CTO &ndash; pretty seasoned &ndash; was battling
everyday to get this guy understand that a salesman
cannot sell projects he doesn&rsquo;t know, at all &ndash; and yes,
that salesman was the CEO<sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how management tend to prove itself as the
dumbest department ever: you hire <em>some-area</em> professionals,
you pay them lot of money, you hear what they say,
you eventually ignore them<sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Results?</p>

<ul>
<li>you could have saved a lot just hiring monkeys</li>
<li>you will make people working on stuff against their will</li>
</ul>


<p>Still, <strong>your problem with IT is you</strong>, not IT itself.</p>

<p>Now ask IT guys if they would like to work the agile way: 80%
of them will just tell you &ldquo;of course&rdquo; (at least in europe).
Now ask IT guys how many of them work in a company which
truly promotes agile development, following <strong>both
processes and values</strong>: 15% of them will get back to you
with a positive answer.</p>

<p>A failure, because it means that &ndash; still &ndash; IT
departments don&rsquo;t have the decisional power to
make their job better, easier and safer from
a business perspective<sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/celtics.jpeg"></p>

<h2>Agile is not a reality</h2>

<p>Today I hear too many people talking about agile<sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup>
while too few organizations succesfully implement it
in their own processes: simply, <strong>agile is mainstream but not a
reality</strong>.</p>

<p>You need the right people to truly integrate and implement
an agile methodology, this is a simple fact, and &ldquo;<em>the
right people</em>&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean experts, but people
who truly believe in agile values.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson">Phil Jackson</a>
won 11 NBA titles while coaching Chicago (11)
and the Los Angeles Lakers (5), always using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense">triangle offense</a>.</p>

<p>Look at his teams:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman in his runs with the Bulls</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and Derek Fisher with his first Lakers</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="right" src="/images/red-auerbach.jpg"></p>

<p>Simply, he was preaching the triangle offense and had the
right men at the right time.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Auerbach">Red Auerbach</a>,
the Boston Celtics legend, built several
( as a coach first as well as GM later ) teams
devoted to team-playing, respect and pride.
Counting up to 10 NBA titles.</p>

<p>He had Larry &ldquo;The Legend&rdquo; Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert
Parish, Glenn &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Rivers, Bill Russel&hellip; I should stop:
he simply &ndash; again &ndash; had the right people.</p>

<p><strong>You</strong> say it&rsquo;s a coincidence: less words, more
people.</p>
