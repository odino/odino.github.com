<div class="entry-content "><p>In these days I had a nice chat with
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gogebakan">Önder Göğebakan</a> to exchange
some views about <strong>team leading</strong>: one of the points I loved to face
was how to deal with arrogant coders that <strong>don&rsquo;t want to consider
the indications received from their technical lead</strong>.</p>

<h2>Pulling responsabilites is not that bad</h2>

<p>It makes no difference the reason why the developers is going against your
opinion/advice/dictation: it may be due to inexperience or attitude, and this
is not <em>that</em> bad.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/rooster.jpg"></p>

<p>A developer which pulls responsabilities shows a good attitude, as it
demonstrates that he wants to take a decision based on different variables
evaluated differently than you: passive coders<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> are just a bad
smell within your organization, because they won&rsquo;t ever be as productive
as you might need; don&rsquo;t get me wrong on this: <strong>passive developers are
a valuable asset</strong>, as you can&rsquo;t rely on a team of cocks, but you
shouldn&rsquo;t hire too many passives, since, in a team of 4~6 people there
will be room for 1, maybe 2, washermen.</p>

<p>Push systems are just a bad idea: if you throw duties and responsabilities
to your developers they won&rsquo;t feel comfortable with them and will suddenly
fear the assigned tasks; make a developer pull his responsabilities and you
will be able to work in a strongy energized, motivated, self aware and
fast growing team<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you will ever be in troubles when a proactive developer go against
your decision, I want to share with you a few thoughts on that.</p>

<h2>Use exampl&hellip;your experience</h2>

<p>Being a CTO, team leader, technical fellow or whatever, you gained
so much experience from your previous &ldquo;developer&rsquo;s years&rdquo; that you have
an unvaluable knowledge about problem solving, and when I say
unvaluable I mean that there&rsquo;s no inexperienced brain that could
overcome a seasoned veteran.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/jordan.jpg"></p>

<p>Think about the way you solved that technical problem earlier in your
career and start adding examples to your cause: don&rsquo;t pretend to
think that this new problem &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the same I saw in <code>some company</code>
back in 2001&rdquo;, because the developer will think that your are
just scratching the surface of the issue and will look at you
with no trust.</p>

<p>When Michael Jordan got back into the NBA for the second time,
with the partially self-owned team of the Washington Wizards,
he was 38, and wasn&rsquo;t able to provide the physical strength,
speed and responsiveness that he had back on his 20s.</p>

<p>Although all of this, the great thing that Mike did was to <strong>take
advantage of his experience</strong> to overcome youger players and
rough defenders: without a fully-supporting body, he was able to
perform great games, with a
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200112290WAS.html">51-points legendary performance</a>
against the Charlotte Hornets, just to mention one episode.</p>

<p>At 38.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think your technical knowledge will be as exhaustive as
during your full-development period, but take advantage of the
situations occurred during those valuable years.</p>

<h2>Approach the problem from different points of view</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/sheldon.board.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper">Sheldon Cooper</a>
has a huge problem in his life: he&rsquo;s not open to
look at the situations he faces from perspectives different
from his own one.</p>

<p>This makes impossible, for him, to solve decisional problems
taking different looks, from different point of views: one
aspect of your job is to provide different solutions to the
same problem instead.</p>

<p>Solutions may be incomplete, or may be not suitable for the
developer against you, but will help you in gaining trust when
explaining your points: someone stucked to his view may be
considered stubborn and not qualificated, but if you are able
to <strong>provide different pros and cons to different solutions</strong>
you will get respect from the person at the other side of
the argument, as you will be recognized not as a firm
believer, but as a thinker.</p>

<h2>Make spikes</h2>

<p>It may sound inefficient, but spikes are a good way to bring your
result home: you are not meant to directly write a spike for a
<em>use case</em> but you should <strong>encourage the counterpart to start
writing small and rough pieces of code</strong> to test if some of the
solutions he thiks are gonna work seem to be working fine.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/lego.technic.jpg"></p>

<p>This makes the developer feel that he&rsquo;s  gaining trust from you,
as he is allowed to actually spend some billable time on his
implementation, but as some problem comes out ask him how to
solve it: a good developer may immediately find that he was wrong
about it, so your problem is solved; if he keeps trying to follow
this deadly way &ndash; maybe for <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CowboyCoder">pride</a>
&ndash; just move at the subsequent step, which means making the
developer recognise he needs help.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that whenever you decide to make a spike, something
practical actually happens, and it could turn out that the
implementation you were criticizing may accomplish its duty:
since no one is perfect prepare your words to congratulate with
the developer and thank him for the good approach, <strong>without
feeling embarassed</strong>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/socrates.gif"></p>

<h2>Consolidate doubts</h2>

<p>With a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">socratic approach</a>,
as you see that he is developing some spikes but <strong>comes to
unacceptable endpoints</strong>, start smashing his beliefs pointing
out the flaws his design has, the possible problems that you are
going to face and the limitations that this piece of code will
bring to his direct components &ndash; just to mention a few possible
type of problems.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend you to read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_(Plato)">The Republic</a>,
by Plato, to understand how the socratic approach works in
practice: it&rsquo;s a really good practice to <strong>rely on ancient wisdom</strong>
to solve inter-people issues, as this kind of knowledge is
transversal to any kind of context.</p>

<h2>Give trust, feed the monster and save him before death</h2>

<p>May 8, 1970: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed">Willis Reed</a>,
captain and leader of the
<a href="http://www.nba.com/knicks/">New York Knickerbockers</a> is
injured, and the Knicks need to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers
in game 7 (last game of a 3-3 tied series) to become NBA champions.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/walt.frazier.jpg"></p>

<p>Willis starts the game, sinks down the first two points for New York
with a perimetral shot and, well, then he stops there.</p>

<p>Your developer is Reed: he&rsquo;s under pressure, feels he can&rsquo;t solve
the situation but dramatically tries not to drown; <strong>there comes Walt</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier">Walt Frazier</a> is a
tiny little point guard, a decent scorer: he&rsquo;s facing
LA&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West">Jerry West</a>, one of the
legends of the NBA, named Mr. Clutch due to his ability to stay
focused and sink shots in high-pressure conditions.</p>

<p>Walt does not care: inspired by his captain, he puts together an awesome
performance, scoring 36 points, serving 19 assists and stealing several
balls from West&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time &ndash; for you &ndash; to play as Walt &lsquo;Clyde&rsquo; Frazier: as the developer
is drowning down you need to come there, <strong>give him the advices</strong> to fix his
implementation and to get out of that situation, <strong>pair with him</strong> and make
him feel that <strong>you could also be in that situation</strong>, it&rsquo;s not such a big
problem: doing this he will firmly listen to you, as you are leading
him out of troubles, the best way to gain respect from others.</p>

<h2>Gain trust</h2>

<p>The key to lead a team is gain trust from its components: it is rarely acceptable
that a team leader could lead his team with a cocky behaviour, so you are
going to fail if your only aim is to do <strong>people management</strong>, and not team
leading.</p>

<p>Letting people pull responsabilities, giving them trust, analyzing with the
team the problems which may occur after a decision (an implementation, or
the change of a process), involving everyone in your job.</p>

<p>As I like to state:</p>

<blockquote><p>Great leaders let other leaders emerge.</p></blockquote>


<h2>Be humble and step back</h2>

<p>What if you were wrong? It may happen, and it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable:
don&rsquo;t be rude when supporting your ideas, because as it turns out
that you were wrong, this may harm your position.</p>

<p>If you sell yourself as a humble guy, you will get the trust of your
team, because <strong>they will recognize you as a wise guide</strong>, not a tyrant.</p>
