<div class="entry-content"><p>As I have to rest after an intense week, full of conferences and sickness, I post my recap about the Symfony Live, what I liked and what I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/symfony.live.jpg"></p>

<p>The whole picture isn&rsquo;t that good but, after all, I however enjoyed the event, which has been attended by, I think, something like 500 people.</p>

<p>For me, it was the first time is Paris and, generally, France, so I could also appreciate a &ndash; seems &ndash; great culture.</p>

<h2>At lunch</h2>

<p>We had really awful moments at lunch: in 2 days, 2 sandwiches and a catering level non that good.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a big problem: in such this kind of conferences what we eat is not so important, but it would give the event a real plus.</p>

<h2>Fabien keynoting</h2>

<p>Ah, another bad moment, and I&rsquo;m not referring to the technical problem the presentation had: being there, with probably the most wanted session, with no slides, had been an awful decision.</p>

<p>The whole talk has not been so involving, so I was a bit disappointed by this so expected moment.</p>

<h2>The talks</h2>

<p>Something went fine, something really bad: HTTP cache by Fabien was really awesome, as Twig&rsquo;s presentation from Ryan Weaver, but &ndash; practically &ndash; all the other speakers ( excluding a couple of minors ) weren&rsquo;t able to catch my attention: the level of their talks wasn&rsquo;t the expected one.</p>

<p>This Symfony Live wasn&rsquo;t so technical: I tought I had the opportunity to learn far more than what I actually learned.</p>

<h2>The level</h2>

<p>Apart some really disappointing talks, I was pleased to have the opportunity of listening people like Wage and Weaver, and &ndash; obviously &ndash; Fabien too.</p>

<p>There was a lot of quality-people at the Symfony Live, and meeting such this kind of developers is not usual.</p>

<h2>Parties</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to attend the first day party, nor GitHub&rsquo;s one the day after, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they gave the partecipants a lot of fun: it&rsquo;s really great that fun plays a primary role at this events.</p>

<h2>The location</h2>

<p>A really cool one, but everything got screwed up when we saw the rooms: a gigantic one for the first track, an awfully small one ( 30 people ) for the second track.</p>

<p>I gotta admit that I renounced to follow a couple talks because there was no space in the second room!</p>

<h2>Unconference</h2>

<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t attended any talk of the unconference track I really like when this initiatives happen: really thank to Stefan Koopmanschap for the effort; my friend Jacopo had the opportunity to give a 10-minutes talk.</p>

<h2>A HTML fragments specification</h2>

<p>I had the opportunity to talk with Fabien for five minutes: my aim was to ask him support for one of the things I do really care a lot, a <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/17357">specification for the HTML fragments media type</a>, possibly including also the ESI specification inside it.</p>

<h2>Next year?</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be at the Symfony Live 2012: it will totally depend from the schedule that will be published.</p>

<p>But, after all, we all should really thank the organizers: a conference is never easy to plan and manage, and they did an awesome job since months.</p>
