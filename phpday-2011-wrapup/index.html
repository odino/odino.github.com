<div class="entry-content "><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I got back from the PHPDay ( ~1 month ) and the experience definitely deserves a post.</p>

<h2>Where, when, how..</h2>

<p>This year&rsquo;s PHPDay has been held in Verona, the wonderful place where Romeo and Juliet had their drama.</p>

<p>The location was the same of the 2009 edition ( which, BTW, was the first conference as a speaker, for me ) with the addition of the third day, just like the last year.</p>

<p>The conference had a first day of workshops and the last 2 days of tutorials and talks: 25 minutes for the former, 45 for the latter.</p>

<h2>Day 1: the german track</h2>

<p>Very curious, the workshop day had an entire track with german speakers: Sebastian Bergmann gave a nice <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/testing-lamp-applications">overview of PHPUnit 3.5</a> with the addition of a live example testing legacy code.</p>

<p>The guys from Quafoo presented the <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/any-any-convert-your-documents">document component from the Apache Zeta Components</a>: seems pretty awesome, given that document conversion is something everyone of us faces during his career and everyone of us blamed TCPDF at least once.</p>

<p>Quafoo again showed us their <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/generic-php-application-installer">application installer</a>, which is an high-level library able to let developers code their own installer according to common needs ( database setup, filesystem configuration and so on ).</p>

<h2>Day 2: tremendous keynote</h2>

<p>My second day started with a topic we&rsquo;re facing in our company: the hard combination between <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/just-married-user-centred-design-and-agile">agile development and user-centered design</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/many-many-no-man-island">Jacopo Romei</a> had an embarassing ( with a positive meaning ) keynote about collaboration and communities: one of the coolest I ever heard, given that I often find keynotes boring.</p>

<p>In the first session of the afternoon I presented the <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/be-lazy-be-esi-http-caching-and-symfony2-0">HTTP cache inside Symfony2</a>, pretty satisfied about the people listening and their feedbacks.</p>

<p>Then I listened about 2 build systems, <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/phing-vs-ant-parola-chiave-automatizzare">Phing and Ant</a>: an insteresting italian talk, given that I didn&rsquo;t know that a few code metrics tools are well-integrated with this kind of systems.</p>

<h2>Day 3: leaving Verona with style</h2>

<p>My attention was firstly captured by the <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/symfony-e-grandi-numeri-si-pu-fare">real-world report about calciomercato.com</a> ( that can be translated in soccertrades.com ), a site, built with symfony 1.4, which scored 4 milions visits in August 2010: definitely impressive.</p>

<p>The talks wasn&rsquo;t obviously focused on the software architecture but on the system architecture behind the website: a cool thing was that they prefered to build 2 separate machine templates ( you usually have 1 VM template, that you scale horizontally ), one used to serve the website and the other for the static assets, some kind of a little CDN.</p>

<p>Giorgio Sironi had an interesting talk about <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/pursuing-domain-driven-design-practices-php">DDD in PHP</a>: it was a real pity that there were a few guys listening him, because DDD is &ndash; obviously &ndash; coupled with doing OO right, and PHPers often forget about them both.</p>

<p>During the afternoon I had the great occasion to present, with David, an overview about the <a href="http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/cmf-pain-f">problems relational DBMS have with fuzzy-model softwares</a>, like CMSes: it has been an opportunity to show off that <a href="http://www.dnsee.com/">DNSEE</a> guys are working hard to develop a CMF based on Symfony2 and a NoSQL graph database, OrientDB.</p>

<h2>So what?</h2>

<p>Once again, the best conference I ever attended, did not betrayed my expectations.</p>
