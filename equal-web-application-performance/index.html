<div class="entry-content "><p>The idea behind equal web performance is that you should
<strong>stop looking at metrics other than the 99th percentile</strong>:
resources shoud be &ldquo;equally&rdquo; distributed across all of your clients so
that a few clients don&rsquo;t act as a bottleneck for the others.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Note that during outages, or when you run at &ldquo;degraded&rdquo; performance,
this is an acceptable practice instead &mdash; drop some of the traffic to
make sure a good portion of your users are able to use
the service, rather than trying to serve more users with
nefarious consequences.</p>

<h2>Averages</h2>

<p>When you measure performances, one of the worst mistakes you
can do is to have a look at averages, as they really don&rsquo;t
tell you anything about how your app is performing.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me?
Let&rsquo;s consider this: I have an application with an average
response time of ~250ms, over 4 requests. The individual requests
recorded these times:</p>

<ul>
<li>request A took 5ms</li>
<li>request B took 5ms</li>
<li>request C took 5ms</li>
<li>request D took 1000ms</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, request D will most likely result in an
unhappy client, one that has to wait around a second to
get a response from our API. If we only look at the average,
though, we wouldn&rsquo;t notice this problem, as ~250ms looks
like an acceptable number to us.</p>

<p>Averages will simply give you a rough idea (which, to me, is fairly
useless), but won&rsquo;t be able to tell you whether you&rsquo;re prioritizing some clients over others, or whether your performance are at an acceptable
level for all of your clients &mdash; this is why you need to start
looking at p50 and p99.</p>

<h2>p50</h2>

<p>The p50 (otherwise known as median), like the average, is kind of an illusion to me: it tells you that half of your traffic is served within a
particular timeframe.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/p50-nr.png"></p>

<p>Even though it is definitely acceptable to look at the p50, I still
feel this is a very &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; metric: what I&rsquo;m really after is making
it great for everyone in the audience, not just half of them.</p>

<h2>p99</h2>

<p>The 99th percentile is, in my head, kind of like the ultimate metric:
I will define a certain number in my head (say 200ms) and think that
&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;d be extremely happy if all my traffic was served within that
timeframe</em>&rdquo; &mdash; that&rsquo;s all I look at.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/p99-nr-overview.png"></p>

<p>I might sometime get distracted by the p50, but the p99 is
really all that matters to me: if the p50 grows from 25 to
100ms I won&rsquo;t be bothered as much, but if the p99 increases
from 100 to 200ms I&rsquo;d be worried sick about it, as I know it
has a larger impact, while the p50&rsquo;s variation is probably
barely noticeable by our clients.</p>

<h2>p100</h2>

<p>Is a dream: systems fail, networks are unreliable, bugs happen.
Consider the p100 utopia, and keep looking at the p99
instead.</p>

<h2>Optimizing for the p99</h2>

<p>I also generally found out that when you optimize for the p99,
you really end up optimizing for everyone: my suggestion is to
look at the slowest responses you&rsquo;re serving and to tackle those
first. Since they are the slowest, fixing these will improve your
averages as well as help all other transactions execute faster,
by removing a slow one that might hog CPU, or memory.</p>

<p>Here are a couple examples of optimizing for the p99 from
our work at <a href="https://tech.namshi.io">Namshi</a> &mdash; the first is taken
from our RDS metrics, and it&rsquo;s the p99 CPU utilization after optimizing
the top queries in our slow query log:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/p99-cw.png"></p>

<p>The second one is from NewRelic, and it shows that by removing
k8s resource limits (as advised by <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/try_except_/optimizing-kubernetes-resource-requestslimits-for-costefficiency-and-latency-highload/42">Zalando</a>) we made apps a lot
more reliable (this is super-duper counter-intuitive, I know):</p>

<p>Adios!</p>
