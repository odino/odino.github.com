<div class="entry-content"><p>I know, I&rsquo;m a month late, but I need to publish a report about <a href="http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/">this amazing conference</a> which took place in Antwerp, Belgium, in January 2011.</p>

<p>It has been one of my favourite conference, and the reasons for such this kind of evaluation are multiple: I try to summarize them here.</p>

<h2>The talks</h2>

<p>This is probably the conference in which I did the rightest moves: almost every talk I attended impressend me so much.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the list:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>27 ways to be a better developer</strong> by Ivo Jansch &amp; Lorna Mitchell, a good keynote focusing on real life experience and a few commonly forgotten tips</li>
<li><strong>Technical Debt</strong> by Elizabeth Naramore, a really cool talk about real life approaches to technical debt</li>
<li><strong>Project triage &amp; recovery</strong> by Keith Casey, about dealing with technical debt in an OS project</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarking applications and frameworks</strong> by Paul M. Jones, dealing with the right approach during applications benchmarks</li>
<li><strong>Charsets and encodings</strong> by Kore Nordmann, in which I learned a lot about a problem I&rsquo;ve never faced but&hellip;   &hellip;who knows&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>XML vs The new kids on the block</strong> by David Zuelke, a really coll comparation between XML, JSON, HTML5 and YAML, with pros and cons for all of them: contextualization was the leit-motif</li>
<li><strong>Designing HTTP interfaces and RESTful webservices</strong> by David Zuelke, a f****** awesome talk, and, have to say, the greatest speaker I&rsquo;ve ever encountered</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation and maps with PHP</strong> by Derick Rethans, pretty boring talk about a cool topic</li>
<li><strong>Zeta Components</strong> by Tobias Schlitt, presenting the Apache project and giving some code examples which turned the crowd on</li>
</ul>


<h2>The organization</h2>

<p>Really awesome.</p>

<p>We had great lunches, an awesome dinner offered by Facebook and almost everyday a free bar.</p>

<p>:&ndash;)</p>

<p>The location they choose was ok and the talks organization really pleasant.</p>

<h2>The bowling night</h2>

<p>I should tell a lot about that night, but I&rsquo;d rather keep some details with those who were there :&ndash;)</p>

<p>We had free ber offered by GitHub and a bunch of bowling lanes reserved for the conference attendees.</p>

<p>It was also cool because at this conferences speakers tend to aggregate with theirselves: at this one we had he opportunity to bowl together.</p>

<h2>The italian crew</h2>

<p>Yes, the cool guys.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been there with other italian fellas, and we probably were the farest guys from home (except from a few speakers ).</p>

<p>Really great time spent together, and I also appreciated Michelangelo Van Dam, one of the organizers, thanking us, while smoking a cigarette, for coming there.</p>

<p>Definitely going there in 2012.</p>

<h2>There is one more thing&hellip;</h2>

<p>Cirpo&rsquo;s beer spill. Amazing.</p>
