    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the best feeling ever, while heading
a team of (web) engineers, is when you lead
them to one particular thing: do <strong>not make the
same mistakes you made</strong> back at the time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/namshi-team.jpg"></p>

<p>For our people it&rsquo;s pretty interesting, since
most of them didn&rsquo;t work with automated tests
and enterprise framework before we decided to
go <a href="/tips-and-tricks-for-you-service-oriented-architecture/">SOA</a>,
and the <strong>coolest thing</strong> is to see how juniors
pick things up better, faster than you did back
at the time.</p>

<p>Today I want to introduce you to <a href="http://mohdhallal.github.io/">Mohammad Hallal</a>,
who joined us around 3 months ago, fresh from
university.</p>

<p>His dedication and will led him to be a very
valuable element of a team full of seniors,
and he decided to make the big step,
starting to <strong>share his experience</strong>
with a technical blog.</p>

<p>Kudos to Hallal, and don&rsquo;t miss his first post,
an introduction about <a href="http://mohdhallal.github.io/blog/2013/09/22/behat-mink-and-parallel-runner-a-recipe-for-automated-web-testing/">BDD, Behat and automated testing</a>!</p>
