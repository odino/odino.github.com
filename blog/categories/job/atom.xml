    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to expand our team we are now looking for a
frontend JavaScript developer that loves Angular and wants to
drown under loads of <code>ng-*</code>, FPS optimizations and
building the frontends for our
<a href="/tips-and-tricks-for-you-service-oriented-architecture/">Service Oriented Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>If you are also interested in helping on the whole stack, here&rsquo;s a
summary of the rest of the technologies we&rsquo;re using down here at
<a href="http://namshi.com">Namshi</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I must admit that is has been pretty exciting to get our
hands dirty with all of these (and the less attractive ones
as well :-P).</p>

<p>Dubai is a pretty nice place and we are <strong>very</strong> open
to relocations: if I&rsquo;m writing this blog post it&rsquo;s because
I would like to reach everyone on the internet who wants
to give it a shot, and not only our connections here in
Dubai.</p>

<p>Namshi is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NThxiu1HGgM">fun workplace</a>
and you&rsquo;re gonna be working with an
<a href="http://tech.namshi.com/portfolio/">highly skilled team</a>
with the goal of delivering the best customer experience in
the Middle East, through a website that should ideally
render in ~100ms, powered by lotsa APIs.</p>

<p>So yeah, what are you waiting for? <code>ng-apply</code> now!</p>

    <id>http://odino.org/namshi-is-looking-for-a-new-lead-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As some of you know, I am currently employed by
<a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com/">Namshi</a>, a
<a href="http://www.rocket-internet.de/">Rocket Internet</a>
venture, here in Dubai, since almost a year: recently,
our CTO <a href="http://halilkoklu.de/">Halil</a> decided to move forward
and start a new adventure pretty far from here
so, as part of me taking care of other things than
development, we are looking for a new Lead Developer
who can strive, with the team, towards excellence.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We are in the process of building new applications
and API to move towards a SOA architecture, using
cutting-edge libraries (like <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony2</a>), tools
(like <a href="http://behat.org/">Behat</a> and <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>) and practices.</p>

<p>The Job Description is still on his way but I can
post here some of the competencies that we are
looking forward to warmly welcome in the crazy Namshi
family:</p>

<ul>
<li>enterprise practices and patterns, such as automated testing, pair programming</li>
<li>HTTP webservices</li>
<li>you buzz around the PHP5.3+ ecosystem, from the Symfony2 components to tools such as Composer</li>
<li>you have Git for breakfast</li>
<li>RDBMS (MySQL, Percona)</li>
<li>can deal with pre-PHP5.3 frameworks (Zend 1 and Yii)</li>
<li>Solr and/or Memcached</li>
<li>passionate about open source and ideally contributing to it.</li>
</ul>


<p>The salary reflects the demand of skills that we are looking for, and
you will be responsible of the day-to-day development of our
applications.</p>

<p>Just to mention: the United Arab Emirated are a tax-free country,
the weather is amazing (even though for a couple months, during the summer,
its <strong>really</strong> hot) and it&rsquo;s an all-around country, meaning that if you
want, you can enjoy the glamorous side of Dubai or, if you dont feel like<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
you can head towards the old town and enjoy the cultural meshup made
of Indonesia, Thai and Indian food or Arab heritage.</p>

<p>I rushed this post, I know, so you can ask for more informations
in the comments or, even better, drop me an email at
<em>alex.nadalin@namshi.com</em>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
