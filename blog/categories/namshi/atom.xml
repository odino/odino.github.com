<p>If you are also interested in helping on the whole stack, here&rsquo;s a
summary of the rest of the technologies we&rsquo;re using down here at
<a href="http://namshi.com">Namshi</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I must admit that is has been pretty exciting to get our
hands dirty with all of these (and the less attractive ones
as well :-P).</p>

<p>Dubai is a pretty nice place and we are <strong>very</strong> open
to relocations: if I&rsquo;m writing this blog post it&rsquo;s because
I would like to reach everyone on the internet who wants
to give it a shot, and not only our connections here in
Dubai.</p>

<p>Namshi is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NThxiu1HGgM">fun workplace</a>
and you&rsquo;re gonna be working with an
<a href="http://tech.namshi.com/portfolio/">highly skilled team</a>
with the goal of delivering the best customer experience in
the Middle East, through a website that should ideally
render in ~100ms, powered by lotsa APIs.</p>

<p>So yeah, what are you waiting for? <code>ng-apply</code> now!</p>

<p>For the first time ever, I have to admit it, I will be
presenting <strong>3 topics that have very different backgrounds</strong>,
and, as the days go by, I realize that working at <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a>
has been terrific under this point of view: we have the ability of
experimenting with different technologies and use the best out on the
market, something that gets translated into the ability of having a
360° overview of the market.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/montreal.jpg"></p>

<p>For me it will be the first time in the cold lands of Canada, and
I can&rsquo;t wait to make the most out of this trip: I always had a <strong>very</strong>
good opinion about canadians in general, hope this trip will
confirm my random thoughts.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to join, don&rsquo;t miss this amazing event:
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/2014/sessions">the schedule</a> speaks for itself
and I am thrilled to be part of such an amazing speakers' lineup
&mdash; which I obviously ruin :&ndash;) !</p>

a team of (web) engineers, is when you lead
them to one particular thing: do <strong>not make the
same mistakes you made</strong> back at the time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/namshi-team.jpg"></p>

<p>For our people it&rsquo;s pretty interesting, since
most of them didn&rsquo;t work with automated tests
and enterprise framework before we decided to
go <a href="/tips-and-tricks-for-you-service-oriented-architecture/">SOA</a>,
and the <strong>coolest thing</strong> is to see how juniors
pick things up better, faster than you did back
at the time.</p>

<p>Today I want to introduce you to <a href="http://mohdhallal.github.io/">Mohammad Hallal</a>,
who joined us around 3 months ago, fresh from
university.</p>

<p>His dedication and will led him to be a very
valuable element of a team full of seniors,
and he decided to make the big step,
starting to <strong>share his experience</strong>
with a technical blog.</p>

<p>Kudos to Hallal, and don&rsquo;t miss his first post,

attending and speaking at the 2013 edition of the
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php">Forum PHP Paris</a>:
funny enough, I&rsquo;ve only been to Paris for conferences so far,
as my <em>first-timer</em> there was during the

<p>Topic of my talk will be what we&rsquo;ve witnessed
at <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#894">Namshi building our team and stack</a>:
from recruiting talents to automated testing, from
SOA&rsquo;s rules to deciding to use cutting-edge technologies

opportunity to
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/inscription.php">reserve your seat for the event</a>,
since there will be amazing speakers, like
Igor Wiedler talking about <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#967">Stack</a>,
PHP&rsquo;s rack, and
Dustin Whittle who will give his insights about

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Sending HipChat notifications in PHP]]></title>
    <link href="http://odino.org/sending-hipchat-notifications-in-php/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-19T14:20:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://odino.org/sending-hipchat-notifications-in-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I added a couple handlers to
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator">Notificator</a>, one for
RabbitMQ and another for <a href="https://hipchat.com">HipChat</a>: in
this post I would like to show you how easy is to integrate
HipChat within your systems.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The handler takes advantage of the
<a href="https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-php">PHP SDK</a> that the HipChat
team built, which is very, very good and
<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/hipchat/hipchat-php">available through packagist</a>.</p>

<p>First thing you will need to do, is to create an instance of a
notification manager and adding the handler to it, with
an HipChat client and the API token you can generate from the HipChat
admin interface:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Namshi\Notificator\Manager;
use Namshi\Notificator\Notification\Handler\HipChat as HipChatHandler;
use HipChat\HipChat;
use Namshi\Notificator\Notification\HipChat\HipChatNotification;</p>

<p>$hipChatClient  = new HipChat(&lsquo;YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE&rsquo;);
$hipChatHandler = new HipChatHandler(%hipChatClient);
$manager        = new Manager();
$manager->addHandler($hipChatHandler);
```</p>

<p>Then you only need to define a notification with a few, HipChat-specific,
properties and trigger it:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>$notification = new HipChatNotification(</p>

<pre><code>'YOLO!', // message
'Alex',  // sender
'room1', // name of the room you want this message to appear
array(
    'hipchat_notify'            =&gt; true, // optional: should send notifications to everyone?
    'hipchat_color'             =&gt; HipChat::COLOR_GREEN, // optional: background color of the notification
    'hipchat_message_format'    =&gt; HipChat::FORMAT_TEXT, // optional: text or html
)
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<p>$manager->trigger($notification);</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The result is pretty self-explanatory:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hipchat-php.png"></p>

<p>Kind of the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/blob/master/examples/hipchat.php">same code</a>
is also available, as an example,
on the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator">notificator repository</a>,
under the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/tree/master/examples">examples</a> folder.</p>

<p>The greatness of Notificator are its handlers, so if you feel
we should add another, useful handler, just shout out!
Even better, you can contribute to the project by sending
a <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/pulls?direction=desc&amp;page=1&amp;sort=created&amp;state=closed">pull request</a>
like <a href="https://twitter.com/cirpo">Alessandro</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/pborreli">Pascal</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/cordoval">Luis</a> already did!</p>
