<div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a couple months that we <strong>renewed a few aspects of our experience</strong>, as developers, here at DNSEE, introducing a few practices that common software factories ignore: we &ndash; and I &ndash; don&rsquo;t know if these practices will always be fine for our daily job but, as far as we saw, things are just working fine.</p>

<h2>Behaviour-driven development</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/behat.logo.png"></p>

<p>We introduced <a href="http://behat.org/">Behat</a> in a pilot project, in order to ease the process of veryfing features delivered, which is done by our QA guy, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/villagiovanni">Giovanni</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, BDD lets developers and <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/product-owner">product owners</a> speak an <strong>ubiquitous language</strong>, thus the PO can write the test-cases for the development team, in <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin</a> language:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example of a Gherkin story</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
</span><span class='line'>   In order to realize a named business value
</span><span class='line'>   As an explicit system actor
</span><span class='line'>   I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>   Scenario: Some determinable business situation
</span><span class='line'>     Given some precondition
</span><span class='line'>       And some other precondition
</span><span class='line'>      When some action by the actor
</span><span class='line'>       And some other action
</span><span class='line'>       And yet another action
</span><span class='line'>      Then some testable outcome is achieved
</span><span class='line'>       And something <span class="k">else </span>we can check happens too
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>thus you &ndash; developer &ndash; are not always required to write a test for every feature in the project: this task is done by the PO, <strong>helped by you</strong> ( while experienced PO may not need your help, at all ).</p>

<h2>The scope of the tests</h2>

<p>We usually develop projects with the RAD framework <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony 1.4</a>, which comes bundled with <em>Lime</em>, a ( limited ) <strong>unit and functional testing tool</strong>: we are now testing features wanted by the stakeholders of the projects with Behat, and functionally testing those ones who require pretty <strong>complex DOM checks</strong>.</p>

<p>Unit tests cover almost every class which are dangerous not to test: apart from these classes, we also use <strong>unit tests to test forms</strong>, because a form can behave in different ways based on the input it receives: since you should tests those forms in a functional test, submitting several times the form and veryfing the expected output, functional tests become very slow ( a test-suite is slow, IMHO, when it lasts more than 10 minutes ): thus, we decided to unit test the forms ( in symfony 1.4, they all are objects, so easy to unit test ).</p>

<p>Unit testing forms means faster test-suites, since, in functional ones we only test the <em>happy path</em>, which is <strong>submitting good values to the form and veryfing the expected successfull output</strong> ( thanks <a href="http://www.agiledevelopment.it/">Jacopo Romei</a> for suggesting it ).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/kit.jpg"></p>

<h2>Capifony</h2>

<p>We started using Capistrano through <a href="http://capifony.org/">Capifony</a>, the automatic-deployment utility written for symfony 1.4: at every commit the developer is responsible of generating the proper doctrine migrations and deploy ( deployment usually takes&hellip; one bash command ) with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Simple capifony usage</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cap deploy deploy:migrate
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since we also wanted to ease the process of updating the issue tracker and BDD reports, we created a script that launches the test-suite ( BDD, functional, unit, integration tests ), deploys with Capifony and publishes the BDD reports on Alfresco, the platform we use for sharing documents: it&rsquo;s a dummy bash script, similar to this one.</p>

<h2>SCRUM</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/scrum.jpg"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hidden, we are trying to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development">SCRUM</a>) as a framework for our processes: I prefer XP, mainly because there&rsquo;s no <em>CrapMaster</em> and the whole team is connected ( I repeat it, <a href="http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/xp/xp/guidances/concepts/whole_team_7E4B7BE3.html">whole team</a> ) but things seem to work fine.</p>

<p>Our first ScrumMaster, <a href="http://it.linkedin.com/in/acceli">Andrew</a>, tought us the basics of the framework and helped us in becoming a SCRUM team; as he left, <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/130822-daniela-cecchinelli">Daniela</a> started following the team as <em>product owner</em>, giving some hints to <a href="http://www.davidfunaro.com/">David</a>, which is trying to act as the new ScrumMaster, and the rest of the team.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>We are basically dedicating much more time to OS development: <a href="https://github.com/congow/Orient">Orient</a> is just <a href="https://github.com/congow">one of the libraries sponsored by DNSEE</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we are also continuing the effort of developing our CMF, <a href="https://github.com/congow/congow">ConGoW</a>, but things are going a bit slow and we are keeping it <em>inter nos</em> until we will have a usable version of the framework.</p>

<p>The effort of exposing ourselves to the OS world is paying off now: a few customers are coming asking for mainly-technical works, like refactoring an old-style architecture or re-writing their webservices.</p>

<p>If you find this point strange to mention, consider that DNSEE is a <a href="http://www.webranking.eu/Articles/Articles/2011/Eni--Best-in-online-communication-2010/">leading agency</a> in communication and creativity, thus not born with a technical focus: what else do I need to say? <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlombardi">Alex</a>, our CTO, has done a tremendous work.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that lots of guys who read this blog are aware of this tecniques/processes, so this won&rsquo;t be a groundbreaking discovery: my intention is to share how we try to manufacture software in DNSEE and hear, from y&#8217;all, some other points of view.</p>
