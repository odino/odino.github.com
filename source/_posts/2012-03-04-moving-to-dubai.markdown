Yes, you got it.
<!-- more -->

Last thursday I resigned from my lead developer position at [DNSEE](http://dnsee.com)
to be able to join [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de/) for their exciting projects
in the middle east area.

After more than 2 years in DNSEE, I really owe everyone a hug, and I gotta
say I'm pretty excited for my relocation, which is gonna lead me to Dubai on the 30 or 31
of this month.

I will be in charge of one of the teams in Dubai, reporting to [Halil](http://de.linkedin.com/in/halilkoklu), as a team leader.

I have no words, really: after a brief visit to my parents (it has been a very sad weekend, believe me),
I'm just **so excited** to start this new challenge.

Wish me luck guys, wish me luck.
