So this is my final attempt to ensure my nerdy passions and my will to blog will
keep up together.
<!-- more -->

Being a nerd, it's fun to spend time on something like *deploying my new article*
or stuff like that: thanks to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) my technical
sadism has been satisfied and now I can run my own blog to [Github](http://github.com),
thanks to *Github pages*.

I am porting the old most viewed contents here, with some rewrites to ensure old
links will not break (301).
