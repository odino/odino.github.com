I am very happy to announce that next February I will
be attending the [Confoo 2014](http://confoo.ca/) and [speaking as well](http://confoo.ca/en/speaker/alessandro-nadalin),
with a good lineup of talks:

* [OrientDB, the fastest NoSQL graph database](http://confoo.ca/en/2014/session/orientdb-the-fastest-document-based-graphdb)
* building a [SOA with Symfony2](http://confoo.ca/en/2014/session/soa-with-symfony2)
* [is AngularJS the future?](http://confoo.ca/en/2014/session/angularjs-is-the-future-maybe)

For the first time ever, I have to admit it, I will be
presenting **3 topics that have very different backgrounds**,
and, as the days go by, I realize that working at [Namshi](http://en-ae.namshi.com)
has been terrific under this point of view: we have the ability of
experimenting with different technologies and use the best out on the
market, something that gets translated into the ability of having a
360Â° overview of the market.

For me it will be the first time in the cold lands of Canada, and
I can't wait to make the most out of this trip: I always had a **very**
good opinion about canadians in general, hope this trip will
confirm my random thoughts.

If you have the chance to join, don't miss this amazing event: 
[the schedule](http://confoo.ca/en/2014/sessions) speaks for itself
and I am thrilled to be part of such an amazing speakers' lineup
-- which I obviously ruin :-) !
