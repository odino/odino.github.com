A few weeks ago [@cirpo](https://twitter.com/cirpo) and me
flew back to Italy to partecipate to the 2014 edition of the
[PHPDay](http://2014.phpday.it/) in Verona, sharing our
experience building APIs.

It was really a great time, especially since I missed the
event in the past couple of years, so it was a blast to see
those good'old tech-friends again.

Our presentation, titled "[Don't screw it up: how to build durable
web APIs](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/dont-screw-it-up-how-to-build-durable-web-apis-phpday-2014-in-verona-ita)", went [pretty well](https://joind.in/talk/view/11310): have a look below and let me know
if you have any feedback!
