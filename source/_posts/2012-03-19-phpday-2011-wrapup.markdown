It's been a while since I got back from the PHPDay ( ~1 month ) and the experience definitely deserves a post.

## Where, when, how..

This year's PHPDay has been held in Verona, the wonderful place where Romeo and Juliet had their drama.

The location was the same of the 2009 edition ( which, BTW, was the first conference as a speaker, for me ) with the addition of the third day, just like the last year.

The conference had a first day of workshops and the last 2 days of tutorials and talks: 25 minutes for the former, 45 for the latter.

## Day 1: the german track

Very curious, the workshop day had an entire track with german speakers: Sebastian Bergmann gave a nice [overview of PHPUnit 3.5](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/testing-lamp-applications) with the addition of a live example testing legacy code.

The guys from Quafoo presented the [document component from the Apache Zeta Components](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/any-any-convert-your-documents): seems pretty awesome, given that document conversion is something everyone of us faces during his career and everyone of us blamed TCPDF at least once.

Quafoo again showed us their [application installer](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/generic-php-application-installer), which is an high-level library able to let developers code their own installer according to common needs ( database setup, filesystem configuration and so on ).

## Day 2: tremendous keynote

My second day started with a topic we're facing in our company: the hard combination between [agile development and user-centered design](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/just-married-user-centred-design-and-agile).

[Jacopo Romei](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/many-many-no-man-island) had an embarassing ( with a positive meaning ) keynote about collaboration and communities: one of the coolest I ever heard, given that I often find keynotes boring.

In the first session of the afternoon I presented the [HTTP cache inside Symfony2](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/be-lazy-be-esi-http-caching-and-symfony2-0), pretty satisfied about the people listening and their feedbacks.

Then I listened about 2 build systems, [Phing and Ant](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/phing-vs-ant-parola-chiave-automatizzare): an insteresting italian talk, given that I didn't know that a few code metrics tools are well-integrated with this kind of systems.

## Day 3: leaving Verona with style

My attention was firstly captured by the [real-world report about calciomercato.com](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/symfony-e-grandi-numeri-si-pu-fare) ( that can be translated in soccertrades.com ), a site, built with symfony 1.4, which scored 4 milions visits in August 2010: definitely impressive.

The talks wasn't obviously focused on the software architecture but on the system architecture behind the website: a cool thing was that they prefered to build 2 separate machine templates ( you usually have 1 VM template, that you scale horizontally ), one used to serve the website and the other for the static assets, some kind of a little CDN.

Giorgio Sironi had an interesting talk about [DDD in PHP](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/pursuing-domain-driven-design-practices-php): it was a real pity that there were a few guys listening him, because DDD is - obviously - coupled with doing OO right, and PHPers often forget about them both.

During the afternoon I had the great occasion to present, with David, an overview about the [problems relational DBMS have with fuzzy-model softwares](http://www.phpday.it/2011/session/cmf-pain-f), like CMSes: it has been an opportunity to show off that [DNSEE](http://www.dnsee.com/) guys are working hard to develop a CMF based on Symfony2 and a NoSQL graph database, OrientDB.

## So what?

Once again, the best conference I ever attended, did not betrayed my expectations.
