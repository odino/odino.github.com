In order to get [our backend team](http://tech.namshi.io/team) to familiarize with React, I ran a quick intro
to the library, based on "evolving" a JSFiddle from a single, static component
to adding UI interactions, using props / state and so on. Nothing groundbreaking
but something that covers the most important bits of React.

I summarized my intro in a repo called "[React in 1000 words](https://github.com/odino/react-in-1000-words)"
and wanted to share it here as well, in case anyone finds it useful.

The goal of the guide is to get people who haven't worked with React before
familiar with the most important concepts, and illustrate how easy it is to
compose interfaces based on loosely-coupled React components. Feel free to send
a PR, but let's keep the word count low! :)
