In the past weeks I've been thinking of collecting
a list of posts of the "*X considered harmful*" articles,
so yesterday I just created a simple [github repo](https://github.com/odino/considered-harmful)
with the very first few articles I've been able to
find (interesting).

<!-- more -->

There has been [a lot of criticism](http://meyerweb.com/eric/comment/chech.html)
around these type of posts, but I believe, especially for the
more recent ones, that they are written with good intentions
(ie. [Lea Verou on jQuery](http://lea.verou.me/2015/04/jquery-considered-harmful/)).

Would love to get your inputs on the list!
