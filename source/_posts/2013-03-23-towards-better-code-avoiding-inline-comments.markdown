One of the things I'm very concerned of is to be
a replaceable element in a development team: this
often translates into producing clean code that
another good developer can immediately understand.

In this post I will share why I am against inline
comments inside your code.

<!-- more -->

Over 6 years of caree I ran across different opinions
towards inline comments:

* *newcomers* usually advocate that they are good, 
and new programmers will benefit of a very detailed
explanation of the code
* most of the programmers are still pro-inline-comments
since they mention the fact that otherwise you wouldn't
remember


DDD, shouldnt have comments
