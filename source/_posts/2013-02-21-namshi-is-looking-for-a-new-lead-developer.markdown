As some of you know, I am currently employed by
[Namshi](http://en-ae.namshi.com/), a
[Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de/)
venture, here in Dubai, since almost a year: recently,
our CTO [Halil](http://halilkoklu.de/) decided to move forward
and start a new adventure pretty far from here
so, as part of me taking care of other things than
development, we are looking for a new Lead Developer
who can strive, with the team, towards excellence.

<!-- more -->

We are in the process of building new applications
and API to move towards a SOA architecture, using
cutting-edge libraries (like [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/)), tools
(like [Behat](http://behat.org/) and [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)) and practices.

The Job Description is still on his way but I can
post here some of the competencies that we are
looking forward to warmly welcome in the crazy Namshi
family:

* enterprise practices and patterns, such as automated testing, pair programming
* HTTP webservices
* you buzz around the PHP5.3+ ecosystem, from the Symfony2 components to tools such as Composer
* you have Git for breakfast
* RDBMS (MySQL, Percona)
* can deal with pre-PHP5.3 frameworks (Zend 1 and Yii)
* Solr and/or Memcached
* passionate about open source and ideally contributing to it.

The salary reflects the demand of skills that we are looking for, and
you will be responsible of the day-to-day development of our
applications.

Just to mention: the United Arab Emirated are a tax-free country,
the weather is amazing (even though for a couple months, during the summer,
its **really** hot) and it's an all-around country, meaning that if you
want, you can enjoy the glamorous side of Dubai or, if you dont feel like{% fn_ref 1 %},
you can head towards the old town and enjoy the cultural meshup made
of Indonesia, Thai and Indian food or Arab heritage.

I rushed this post, I know, so you can ask for more informations
in the comments or, even better, drop me an email at
*alex.nadalin@namshi.com*.

Cheers!
