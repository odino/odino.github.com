At the end of last year I decided to try completely removing Facebook from my life:
truth to be told, FB does a great job at letting you disconnect by deactivating
your account and decide when to come back -- so it was an easy experiment.

In this post I'd like to report a few observations 5 months down the line.

<!-- more -->

## What, and how

Long story short, I de-activated my account and kept it as such for a good month.
In February I then re-activated it and observed how much time I would spend on
the platform on a daily basis.

I basically wanted to see what would have changed by removing such a sometimes useless,
sometimes crucial app from my life, and I was fairly pleased with my findings.
Nothing groundbreaking, but it gave me a good idea of what facebook is really
good for and how I should spend my time on the platform.

## Moving to another social media platform

As soon as I de-activated my account, I noticed a "void": I would leave work and
tap on the blue icon -- only to see a login screen asking me to re-activate my
account. I resisted, and turned my attention towards a different social media
platform: [twitter](https://twitter.com/_odino_).

I generally like twitter more as it provides more "useful" content: articles,
random strangers' observations around general topics and more professional
content overall. Since disconnecting from facebook, I'd say 50% of the time I used
to spend there is now dedicated to twitter, which makes me feel a bit better about
how I spend my (dead) time.

## Vulpem pilum mutare, non mores

Since re-activating my account in February I started spending more and more time
back on FB: for the first couple of weeks I would open it every couple of days or
so, and for the first month I didn't even open it up from my laptop.

Nowadays, I'm back at it on a daily basis: you might think that's a fairly bad outcome,
but my usage of FB has, quite drastically, changed. Earlier, I used to spend time
scrolling through my feed searching for the elusive interesting post from an acquaintance
I haven't seen in 10 years, whereas now I open the app, check my notifications,
close it -- much less time wasted away.

## Reading, reading, reading, read...

Related to the "void", I again found myself with a lot of time beside twitter:
while commuting to work, right after waking up, while brushing my teeth...

I went back to [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/): I used to devour HN on a daily basis, while over the past year
I spent more time on my [kindle](/categories/book/) and focused
less on the daily inspiration HN brings you. This was definitely a plus for me,
as I have now found the time for both books and tech news.

## Disconnecting from everyone

One of the negative points was that a few people only get in touch through FB,
and at that point I cut them out *just like that*. You now how I noticed it?

Enter my dad:

Should be easy to translate but, just in case:

> Hi. Did you close FB?

Stunned, I went back and re-activated my account as I -- ehm -- felt quite bad. I'm quite
terrible at keeping in touch with people, and seeing pops asking me whether I was on
FB or not made me realize he was probably gonna share some interesting NBA highlight
with me, only to notice I wasn't available...

## Unlike THAT!

I also noticed a pattern once back on FB: I was truly annoyed at the amount of
random posts from pages I had liked in my teens that would pop in my feed.
I found myself valuing my time far more, and started to "unlike" those pages like
there's no tomorrow.

Not sure how to describe it but, since I re-activated my account I started to dislike
time-wasters much more than the usual. Guess it's not a bad thing after all.

## What next?

As I mentioned, I don't think FB is (that) evil -- it's just a matter of knowing
how and when to use it. My relationship with the social network is in a much better place (in my opinion,
which is probably not aligned with the advertisers') -- sort
of *it's not you, it's me* kind of thing.

I would recommend you try to get off the hook for a few days, until you don't even
bother tapping on the blue icon out of habit. I learned how valuable FB can be when
keeping in touch with individuals who use it as a primary mean of communication,
and I'm probably spending the least amount of time on FB since I joined the platform
(fun fact: when I joined I used to write in 3rd person -- I guess it was a thing back then).

Advertisers crying in 3, 2...
