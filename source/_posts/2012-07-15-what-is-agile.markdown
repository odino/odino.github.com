I'm a pragmatic programmer, not a pragmatic agilist.

If I had to be a pragmatic agilist during my career,
I'd have been fired several times, and that's why.

## The Agile rape

{% img right /images/televangelist.jpg %}

We hear the word *Agile* everywhere, thanks to the fact that
this is a concept 10 years old, brought to the public by some
of the **greatest minds in computer engineering**, who could also
describe [interesting things](http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420)
other than a cool way to have more fun and be more productive at work.

Let's face it: the word "*Agile*"" has been raped over the past
5 years.
This is not because it became mainstream and everyone 
wanted to adopt it, it's because once it was about to
become mainstream a lot of people heard of it and
wanted to integrate **their own** vision of agile
development into their IT infrastructures.

You read it: **their** own vision.

Take a look at the [lean software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development): we have
the [Poppendieck saga](http://www.amazon.com/Mary-Poppendieck/e/B001IGNU3O/)
and not much more; sure, there are a lot of books and a
lot of opinions about LSD across IT professionals,
nonetheless everyone takes inspiration from the infamous
*weds*, not from what they heard about what they wrote.

Fact, this is the reason why LSD is still a pure oasis
in IT{% fn_ref 1 %}.

## SCRUM

Sure, one of the things I'd point my finger against is SCRUM.

This lightweight agile methodolgy is probably on everyone's
mouth since 3 years, since lot of people adopted it and
it seem to work: nonetheless, SCRUM is failing and will continue failing
in preserving and communicating the legacy of the agile
principles, values and patterns.

{% img right /images/rugby-scrum.jpg %}

The problem with SCRUM is not SCRUM itself, because I
think it *may* work in some contexts, but to the way
people interpret it and implement it in their own
processes:

* the focus is shifted from the IT team and the transparency
betweem the **whole team** to the *product owner*, which acts
as a benevolent dictator between the team and the customer
* whenever you add a layer between programmers and the
customer, you introduce an overhead, which means a less efficient
communication
* SCRUM masters often fail to facilitate, since they become
a bottleneck in the process: if a problem depends to the SM,
N people in the development team have to rely and wait for him,
while, if the team act as a standalone being, each part of it
can theoretically deal with problems applying a FIFO
principle (*first in, first out*, sorting problems by priority
and business value rather than age)
* 1 out of 2 **certified SCRUM masters** that I meet don't
even know how to finish *"Individuals and interactions..."*
which I find first offensive second really frustrating

Yes, the last one is a merely pure personal observation:
still, there's no doubt about the certification itself,
which I find pretty overestimated.

[Formally] **Certifying processes that don't have formal
approaches** is purely counter-intuitive: sorry, agile
processes are not formal{% fn_ref 2 %}.

All in all the history of SCRUM and its adopters teaches
us that a few big corporations are willing to make a step
and try to embrace agile development, with the wrong approach:
if you will to adopt something that - oh, boy! - has a
manifesto you should, in first place, try not to betray
its values, **transparency at first place**.

## We are different

The reality is that I never heard stories from the trenches of
an agile organization: ok, I read them, ok, I heard
something, but I never spoke with someone who illustrated
me a 100% adoption of one agile methodology,
no matter if SCRUM, crystal or XP{% fn_ref 3 %}.

I still think that embracing agile is the winning
option, (almost) no matter when and where:
share with me your stories, I'd be glad to
give them some space here.

Still, agile's biggest problems are both
management and programmers: the management always
has a skeptical eye on new methodologies that
make their teams slower{% fn_ref 4 %} and
programmers often think that they should interpret
their own view of agile development.

Just a mention: I worked several months for a firm
who was selling itself as "agile" or - at least -
"agile-prone", while no one ever did a retrospective
**in months**.

I spoke with PMs, I spoke with the CTO, I spoke with
the programmers: everyone had good intentions but no
one was **eager to be the change**, not to **just talk**.

Back then, it was really frustrating: so no surprise I
parted ways with that organization while account
managers are still there, working every day until 9pm
because "*in this industry it works like this*".

"[We are different](http://www.agiledevelopment.it/2012/01/we-are-different/)",
they said.

## An agile and slower IT would just be a pain for our business

IT is a bottleneck, **get over it**.

Still, most organizations think that the problem between their
ideas and their success is IT, since it tends to slow down and
raise doubts about estimates, delivery times and implementations.

Now, put things this way: you have a great idea, you
know it's gonna work.

Sadly, having an idea and implementing it are different things:
in a case, you think it and it becomes real, in the other
you need to work hard and in a very qualitative way not to
limit and ruin the motivation behind your work - guess
if IT fits in the first or the second case.

Still, **IT is a bottleneck**.

Be fine with it, that's why technicians tend to limit/screw
your ideas: they try to bring you back to reality and suggest
the most credibile solutions to your problems.
They have to be the bottleneck between a management's
childish dreams and reality.

{% img right /images/bottleneck.jpg %}

Still, **agile is a bottleneck**.

Be fine with it, that's why agilists tend to enpower
collaboration: they try to find the best mid-term
solution for your problem, to help your business not
facing IT bottlenecks in *put-some-number-here* months.
They have to be the bottleneck between a management's
lack of knowledge and technology.

That's why the management should listen to its IT
department and get some genuine advices about their
digital strategy and the upcoming issues that technology
could reserve them ( read "it's stupid to spend 600k on
facebook ads for a mini-site if you dont have the right
servers to handle the groundbreaking traffic which
will come from ads themselves" ).

I once worked in a company where the CEO thought we could
do whatever technologic project people would have
asked for: the CTO - pretty seasoned - was battling
everyday to get this guy understand that a salesman
cannot sell projects he doesn't know, at all - and yes,
that salesman was the CEO{% fn_ref 5 %}.

It's funny how management tend to prove itself as the
dumbest department ever: you hire *some-area* professionals,
you pay them lot of money, you hear what they say,
you eventually ignore them{% fn_ref 6 %}.

Results?

* you could have saved a lot just hiring monkeys
* you will make people working on stuff against their will

Still, **your problem with IT is you**, not IT itself.

Now ask IT guys if they would like to work the agile way: 80%
of them will just tell you "of course" (at least in europe).
Now ask IT guys how many of them work in a company which
truly promotes agile development, following **both 
processes and values**: 15% of them will get back to you
with a positive answer.

A failure, because it means that - still - IT
departments don't have the decisional power to
make their job better, easier and safer from
a business perspective{% fn_ref 7 %}.

## Agile is not a reality

Today I hear too many people talking about agile{% fn_ref 8 %}
while too few organizations succesfully implement it
in their own processes: simply, **agile is mainstream but not a
reality**.

You need the right people to truly integrate and implement
an agile methodology, this is a simple fact, and "*the
right people*" doesn't always mean experts, but people
who truly believe in agile values.

[Phil Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson)
won 11 NBA titles while coaching Chicago (11)
and the Los Angeles Lakers (5), always using the [triangle offense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense).

Look at his teams:

* Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman in his runs with the Bulls
* Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Derek Fisher with his first Lakers

{% img right /images/red-auerbach.jpg %}

Simply, he was preaching the triangle offense and had the
right men at the right time.

[Red Auerbach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Auerbach),
the Boston Celtics legend, built several
( as a coach first as well as GM later ) teams
devoted to team-playing, respect and pride.
Counting up to 10 NBA titles.

He had Larry "The Legend" Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert
Parish, Glenn "Doc" Rivers, Bill Russel... I should stop:
he simply - again - had the right people.

**You** say it's a coincidence: less words, more
people.
