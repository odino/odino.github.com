I'm a pragmatic programmer, not a pragmatic agilist.

If I had to be a pragmatic agilist during my career,
I'd have been fired at least 2 times, and that's why.

## The Agile rape

We hear the word *Agile* everywhere, thanks to the fact that
this is a concept 10 years old, brought to the public by some
of the **greatest minds in computer engineering**, who could also
describe [interesting things] other than a cool way
to have more fun and be more productive at work.

Let's face it: the word *Agile* has been raped over the past
5 years.
This is not because it became mainstream and everyone 
wanted to adopt it, it's because once it was about to
become mainstream a lot of people heard of it and
wanted to integrate **their own** vision of agile
development into their IT infrastructures.

You read it: **their** own vision.

Take a look at the [lean software development]: we have
the [Poppendieck saga] and not much more; sure, there are
a lot of books and a lot of opinions about LSD across
IT professionals, nonetheless everyone takes inspiration
from the infamous *weds*, not from what they heard about
what they wrote.

Fact, this is the reason why LSD is still a pure oasis
in IT{% fn_ref 1 %}.

## SCRUM

Sure, one of the things I'd point my finger against is SCRUM.

This lightweight agile methodolgy is probably on everyone's
mouth since 3 years, since lot of people adopted it and
it seem to work: nonetheless, SCRUM is failing and will continue failing
in preserving and communicating the legacy of the agile
principles, values and patterns.

The problem with SCRUM is not SCRUM itself, because I
think it *may* work in some contexts, but to the way
people interpret it and implement it in their own
processes:

* the focus is shifted from the IT team and the transparency
betweem the **whole team** to the *product owner*, which acts
as a benevolent dictator between the team and the customer
* whenever you add a layer between programmers and the
customer, you introduce an overhead, which means a less efficient
communication
* SCRUM masters often fail to facilitate, since they become
a bottleneck in the process: if a problem depends to the SM,
N people in the development team have to rely and wait for him,
while, if the team act as a standalone being, each part of it
can theoretically deal with problems applying a FIFO
principle (*first in, first out*, sorting problems by priority
and business value rather than age)
* 1 out of 2 **certified SCRUM masters** that I meet don't
even know how to finish *"Individuals and interactions..."*
which I find first offensive second really frustrating

Yes, the last one is a merely pure personal observation:
still, there's no doubt about the certification itself,
which I find pretty overestimated.

(Formally) **Certifying processes that don't have formal
approaches** is purely counter-intuitive.

All in all the history of SCRUM and its adopters teaches
us that a few big corporations are willing to make a step
and try to embrace agile development, with the wrong approach:
if you will to adopt something that - oh, boy! - has a
manifesto you should, in first place, try not to betray
its values, transparency at first place.

## We are different

agile al 100% e' un oasi
vorrei sapere chi lo fa, mandatemi le vs storie
il problema e' il management
il problema sono i programmatori
il problema siamo noi per questo siamo differenti

## Collaboration

it bottleneck
se it non deve essere bottleneck, devi stare alle regole IT
se la maggioranza dei progetti IT fallisce chiediti perche'
il management non IT non deve influenzare l'IT
il management che influenza deve essere consapevole

## Agile is not a reality

oggigiorno cio che e' agile e' effimero, senza anima
tutto l'agile che sentiamo e' in realta' chiacchera
agile e' mainstream ma non e' una realta'
agile come attacco a triangolo, ti servono gli uomini giusti e capita 6 anni su 30 di carriera (double team)
