One of the best feeling ever, while heading
a team of (web) engineers, is when you lead
them to one particular thing: do **not make the
same mistakes you made** back at the time.

For our people it's pretty interesting, since
most of them didn't work with automated tests
and enterprise framework before we decided to
go [SOA](/tips-and-tricks-for-you-service-oriented-architecture/), 
and the **coolest thing** is to see how juniors
pick things up better, faster than you did back
at the time.

Today I want to introduce you to [Mohammad Hallal](http://mohdhallal.github.io/),
who joined us around 3 months ago, fresh from 
university.

His dedication and will led him to be a very
valuable element of a team full of seniors,
and he decided to make the big step,
starting to **share his experience**
with a technical blog.

Kudos to Hallal, and don't miss his first post,
an introduction about [BDD, Behat and automated testing](http://mohdhallal.github.io/blog/2013/09/22/behat-mink-and-parallel-runner-a-recipe-for-automated-web-testing/)!
