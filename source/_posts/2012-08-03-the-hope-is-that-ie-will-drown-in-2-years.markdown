More than a decade ago the first [browser war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
made his victim: it was Netscape, which
couldn't compete with Microsoft and its
IE: after long time, it's time for this
decadent winner to retreat.

Today I was spending a few minutes on
[IcanUse](http://caniuse.com/), a brilliant service which
gives you informations on features implemented
by modern web browsers: not surprisingly,
IE is a total disappointment.

So I decided to take a look at what the **current** browsers
are implementing, retrieving some nice
charts to compare them against each other:

{% img center https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&chd=t:31,83,94,75,65|100,100,100,100,100&chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&chs=750x400&chxt=x,y&chbh=120&chtt=Implementation%20of%20JS-related%20feature %}

{% img center https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&chd=t:59,88,97,94,97|100,100,100,100,100&chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&chs=750x400&chxt=x,y&chbh=120&chtt=Implementation%20of%20SVG-related%20feature %}

{% img center https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&chd=t:63,82,89,88,73|100,100,100,100,100&chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&chs=750x400&chxt=x,y&chbh=120&chtt=Implementation%20of%20CSS-related%20feature %}

{% img center https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&chd=t:40,71,94,80,80|100,100,100,100,100&chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&chs=750x400&chxt=x,y&chbh=120&chtt=Implementation%20of%20HTML5-related%20feature %}

It's not a surprise that IE9 is the worst browser out there,
but this made me think about how long it will be
a competitor in the market.

IE is slowly dying, [we all know](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Usage_share_of_web_browsers_%28Source_StatCounter%29.svg):
just as netscape, it's not able to face competitors
pushing hard to deliver the best
web-browsing experience.

It will take a few months, maybe years, to see
IE leaving the market kicked out by the yougsters,
nontheless it will be a great day for the
internet: the day that who fights for the
innovation will definitely overwhelm who
sits on top of his past, glorious days.
