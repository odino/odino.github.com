I am taking some time off to describe my last trip between
Burlingame and San Francisco for the CakeFest 2013.

## First-timer in the States

{% img right /images/usa-flag.jpg %}

It was actually - what a shame! - my first time in the States: given
that I find exotic cultures (SEA, Desi) a bit more attractive, I never took
the time to fly all the way west to visit the probably most discussed
country in the globe.

The flight, around 15 hours in total, was pretty stressful, at least for me, and
the visit VISA process at SFO took way longer than initially expected:
luckily, Italy is part of the VISA waiver program, and at least I didn't get
questioned too much by the federal agents at the airport.

In a couple of hours I am outside of the airport: without any accomodation, I head
towards the [tenderloin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderloin,_San_Francisco),
probably not a wise choice :-)

I spent the first 2 days between Market and 7th, a pretty creepy location at night,
but very enjoyable during the day: from there it's very easy to take a cab or the tram
and get immersed in the tourist's life, visiting places like the Fisherman's Wharf,
Pier 39 or the Embarcadero.

Note to self: I should have checked about the America's cup before: since atteding
one of the races could have been pretty damn awesome!

## Location

{% img right /images/cali-bike.jpg %}

The conference was held right next to the airport, in 
[Burlingame](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=burlingame+san+francisco&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d32160518!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1855!2i947!4f13.1), inside
the Crowne Plaza hotel: the location was easily reachable by BART
and the airport shuttle, if you were staying in the city in those days.

After spending a couple days inside the city itself, I decided to
move to the CP for the rest of my vacation, as it was very comfortable
and convenient - by taking the BART you could get in SF in ~40
minutes.

All in all the Crowne Plaza was a pretty expensive place, but if you,
like me, are lazy and go for the easy choice, you will
find yourself pretty well there: every day (after the conference) I used to
take the shuttle to SFO and the BART there: with less than 20$
per day you would be able to move around San Francisco even though
you are actually sleeping 25km away from downtown.

## Welcome!

The guys from the organization, especially [James](https://github.com/jameswatts),
did a nice job in welcoming people and making them feel at a reunion party
rather than at a formal conference: the atmosphere was very enjoyable and
having people coming from all over the world (Japan, Germany, Dubai, UK, ...)
just gave it that international vibe that only these kind of events
can give you.	

## The community

I was actually surprised to see that CakePHP's "official" annual
event was a bit short in terms of numbers: I can't really compare it
to the [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com/) or the
[Symfony Live](http://live.symfony.com/) since I've never been at the former
and my last visit to the latter was in 2011, but I am sure they get together
a few more nerds.

I think I could count up to 80 people in the main hall during the **hot talks**:
nothing bad, but I was expecting other numbers; for sure, having less people
let everyone talk to each other, as the atmosphere there was very collaborative
and group-oriented: personally, I would like to thank some of the guys for providing
much fun between talks - especially [Angel](https://twitter.com/angelxmoreno) and
[Gary](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=104354&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=9zAl&locale=en_US&srchid=277650061379771493631&srchindex=1&srchtotal=90&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A277650061379771493631%2CVSRPtargetId%3A104354%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary).

## Conference

Technically, the conference went way beyond my expectations: I didn't follow
all the talks (I know, I know) as I was also working during those 2 days, but what
I've seen was very interesting.

There were talk about [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), scaling/autoscaling and
Ember.JS: for me they were very valuable since
[I've never used Cake](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco/3)
and I was actually pretty scared of not finding talks that would inspire me
in my day-to-day job.

Kudos for making the CakeFest an event that a Symfonian can enjoy ;-)

## Aftermath

Last but not least, thank you very much to the crazy guys working
at [LoadSys](http://www.loadsys.com/): it was so much fun to hang
with this crew from Illinois, even though they promised some pool
and we didn't manage to find a place with tables - what a pity!

Besides the fun and the jokes that evening/night was also very
interesting since [Joey](https://twitter.com/joeytrapp)
caught me to discuss the latest developments in the JS
ecosystem, from EmberJS to AngularJS: I must admit that it
was a very inspiring exchange of ideas, and that we both share
the same doubts about long-term, **maintainable NodeJS
architectures**.

## See you next year?

{% img right /images/sf.jpg %}

The city was pretty good, the conference better than anything
I could expect and full of friendly nerds craving for new
concepts, ideas and patterns: all in all, I must admit that
the CakeFest is an event I would definitely like to join
again in the future.

Who knows where the [crazy band is heading next year!](http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/predominant/2013/03/20/cakefest_2013_-_vote_for_the_location)
