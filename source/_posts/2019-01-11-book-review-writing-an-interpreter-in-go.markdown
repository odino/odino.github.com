Boy, what a book!

This goes right into the list of books I would
have wanted to read 10 years ago: a masterpiece
on programming languages, with the author showcasing
an excellent ability to write couple with
extremely exhaustive -- but never boring --
content.

Long story short, [the interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/) should
definitely be on your 2019 reading list unless
you've already read it. If that's the case,
give the book another try, it's probably worth it.

<!-- more -->

First and foremost, I'd like to start by saying that
picking [Go](https://golang.org/) for such a topic was an excellent choice:
not everyone might be familiar with the language,
but its standard library and "strictness" make it
for a perfect choice for these kind of
tasks.

An epic feat is that the book manages to write an
entire interpreter using only the [Go standard library](https://golang.org/pkg/):
yes, no single dependency other than Go itself.

I'm not sure how to put it into words, but the writing
style is also impeccable, as I started this book
and *had to* finish it within 4 hours -- I simply
couldn't get over it.

Writing An Interpreter In Go will spoon-feed you
through the journey of writing "your own programming language",
presenting topics such as writing a lexer and parser
in such a way that even the silliest of human beings
(*hey there, that's me!*) can understand them
easily. I dunno, to me this book is simply a masterpiece.

Worth to note that the author just recently doubled up
with a sequel to this book, [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/),
that takes the codebase you ended up with the interpreter
book and writes a compiler and VM for the language you've
just built.
