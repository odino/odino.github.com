Cross-posting never hurts :)

<!-- more -->

We're currently [looking for a Sr. DevOps engineer and a Sr. JavaScript engineer](http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2016/08/07/currently-hiring-a-devops-engineer-and-a-js-hacker-here-in-dubai/)
here at [Namshi](https://www.namshi.com): the package is attractive and the
learning experience is, in my opinion, well-worth it.

From a DevOps perspective, we work a lot with Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack, Terraform,
Golang and Python -- and everything we run is on AWS.
As a JS engineer instead, expect to be working on SPAs with Angular or React. And a bit of isomorphic JavaScript never
hurts, as well as the ability to dive into the backend with NodeJS.
With 50+ microservices, there's always a chance to learn and experiment over here :)

If you are interested, or happen to know anyone{% fn_ref 1 %} feel free to get in touch with me, or drop
a line to `work-in-tech@namshi.com`.
