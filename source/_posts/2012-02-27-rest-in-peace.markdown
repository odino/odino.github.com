I'm pretty satisfied about the presentation I gave at the [Codemotion](http://www.codemotion.it/) this afternoon.
<!-- more -->

My goal was to give to the attendees consciousness about the constraints that describe an architecture - really - "RESTful" and why implementing a RESTful architecture may leverage

* the power
* the scalability
* the quality
* the excellence
* the durability

of the architecture itself, combining this to the ESI specification, which leads to an effective gateway caching mechanism.

Here are the slides, and really thanks to everyone who attended the session:
