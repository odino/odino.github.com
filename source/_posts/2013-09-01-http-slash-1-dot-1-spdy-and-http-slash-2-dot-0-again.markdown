Today, tired like hell due to an almost sleepless night,
I gave my second (and last) talk at the [CakeFest](http://cakefest.org)
in San Francisco.

<!-- more -->

It was a slightly remixed version of the same talk I gave at the
IPC in Germany last year, with a few addition and changes: I hope the
attendees have enjoyed the conference as well as my 2 **small**
contributions as much as I did.

As usual, the presentation is on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-end-of-the-road-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco):
here are the slides for the lazy ones :)

Cheers!
