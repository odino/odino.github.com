In late november I will be for a few days in Paris,
attending and speaking at the 2013 edition of the
[Forum PHP Paris](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php):
funny enough, I've only been to Paris for conferences so far,
as my *first-timer* there was during the
[2011 edition of the Symfony Live](/symfony-live-2011-my-pov/).

Topic of my talk will be what we've witnessed
at [Namshi building our team and stack](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#894):
from recruiting talents to automated testing, from
SOA's rules to deciding to use cutting-edge technologies
like [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/): don't miss the
opportunity to
[reserve your seat for the event](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/inscription.php),
since there will be amazing speakers, like
Igor Wiedler talking about [Stack](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#967),
PHP's rack, and
Dustin Whittle who will give his insights about
[scaling PHP apps](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#964).

See you in the core of europe!
