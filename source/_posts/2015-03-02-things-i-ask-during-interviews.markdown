description: A brief list of things I generally ask during to kickoff the conversation during an interview

Today I was wasting my time on a trip [back home](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+Dubai+Mall+-+Financial+Center+Road,+Near+Souk+Al+Bahar+Bridge,+DownTown+Dubai+-+%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9+%D8%AF%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%91+-+United+Arab+Emirates%E2%80%AD/Dubai+Marina+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/@25.14228,55.1815421,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f68282fe3dbb1:0xc9a673f9ef407801!2m2!1d55.278896!2d25.197628!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6b5402c126e3:0xb9511e6655c46d7c!2m2!1d55.144075!2d25.08135)
and finally got to create an OS repo I was
thinking of for the past 3/4 weeks: a brief list
of [questions I ask during interviews](https://github.com/odino/interviews).

<!-- more -->

You will find the list split in conceptual
areas: there's some stuff related to [frontend](https://github.com/odino/interviews#frontend),
some [purely logical](https://github.com/odino/interviews#reasoning) question, something related
to [history of programming](https://github.com/odino/interviews#personalities) and so on. This will
definitely help me doing my next interview, and
you might as well take some inspiration for when
you don't really know what to ask.

If you want to contribute to the list
simply [send a PR](https://github.com/odino/interviews/edit/master/README.md) and I will be more than
happy to merge your suggestion!

## PS: the way I structure interviews

As an addendum, I wanted to share the way I conduct
interviews (it would be nice to get a feedback on this,
if you don't mind): I usually spend 5/10 minutes describing
the company, the organization of the tech team and
what we are looking for, to then let the candidate
talk about himself for another 10 minutes.

After that, it's time for some of these questions
and, when I think I'm done, I let the candidate ask
me anything, since I think it's important to have
clear ideas on both sides.

Suggestions are mostly welcome!
