A lot of people blog about their experiences with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and how it helps
them either running apps in production or easily
replicating development environments, so I won't
spend much time on that.

This is post is about how docker changed the way
I think of my personal laptop which is, yes, used
to deploy containers to production and develop
apps through [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
but also to blog and do a lot of personal stuff
with it.

So yes, this is my review of **dockerizing myself**.
