There we go: I am in Bengaluru for OSIDays, and the conference is about to finish today, after cool and less cool moments.

## One hour of TDD: from saying hello to PHPUnit to mocking objects

{% img center /images/osidays.jpg %}

With my first talk I've messed a few things up: as I was plugging the VGA adapter to my laptop, the native screen was loosing signal so I needed to do my session with [Bastian](http://blog.bastian-feder.de/blog.html)'s laptop (dude, you saved my ass).

The session went pretty well:  I gotta confess that I was a bit scared of showing some real-world code examples, step by step, in a live session, so the audience probably felt my preoccupation... after all, the talk quickly took the right direction, and I was able to show the **implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm in PHP with test-driven development**.

The presentation is on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/got-units-osidays) and you can clone the [repository on github](https://github.com/odino/osidays) (slides/code without code/slides are useless).

## RESTful architectures

Oh, that was easy.

Not trying to sound arrogant, but this is probably the 8th time I give this presentation, so I'm pretty used to deliver it.

This edition of [REST in peace](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/rest-in-peace-osidays-2011-india-11212011) is already on slideshare, and it contains a few new things from the other, older, presentations: if you followed me during this months of *RESTvangelization* you'll notice that a few concepts are getting more and more important, like having durable services and taking advantage of the greatest REST architecture, the Web.

The **presentation went well** and a few people actually came after the talk for **having some insights** about implementing a reverse proxy in their architectures and so on...   ...a rails guy even told me we was revisiting his opinion of RoR-powered APIs now :)

I was pretty disappointed by the number of people attending the session (~50) but, from what I saw, it was really complex, for the majority of the attendees, to **understand concepts like evolvability and durability** in a country like India, which is the greatest place in the world to outsource **quick'n'dirty software** ( I hope they're fixing it with this conferences and getting a better *forma mentis* from the software development point of view ).

The organization
Wow, one of the coolest aspects of the conference: they have been able to satisfy every need we had, from transportation to eating, via relaxing in a wonderful hotel.

## Other talks

I attended a few sessions from other eurospeakers like [Hugo Hamon](http://www.hugohamon.com/en), [Bastian Feder](http://blog.bastian-feder.de/blog.html) and the *evergreen* [Tobias](http://schlitt.info/.html): although I basically knew any concept presented there, I felt how those presentations were needed by the audience here at OSIDays, 'cause they are living the moment that PHP was living 6 years ago.

The point is that when you need to write crappy code, that should be production-ready in 48 hours, you don't test anything, you don't decouple anything, you don't design anything: programmers are now forced to work in this way, and the most proficient ones get hired by great companies like IBM or whatever major.

Participating at these conference should make the average indian developer aware of the fact that he has a possibility: to leverage his skills and try to build complex system, not only outsourced stuff.

I think this is a pretty difficult topic, because only a few of them had a real-world experience on what we call *ordinary* projects: without seeing them, they think that the procedural and messy way they have is a good compromise to get the job done.

## And now?

I don't talk about my personal life in this blog, so I will not tell you how things went from this point of view: let's just says that now I have 3 free days for visiting a few cities here in the southern part of India...   ...let's hope they will be amazing as a few moments here in Bengaluru.
