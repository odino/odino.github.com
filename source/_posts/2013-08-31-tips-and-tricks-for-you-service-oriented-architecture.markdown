Today I gave the first of my 2 presentations scheduled for the
[CakeFest](http://cakefest.org) here in San Francisco,
"[Tips and Tricks for your SOA](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco)".

<!-- more -->

It basically contains a few tips derived from our experience at
[Namshi](http://en-ae.namshi.com) while building our own service-oriented
architecture, and I hope, since there's not *that* much material
about SOA out there, that this can serve as a good feedback from who
is actually embracing this architectural style.

As always, the slides are on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco),
and I'm embedding the presentation
here for those who immediately want to have a look at it:

Tomorrow, as per the conference's schedule, I will be giving my other talk,
"HTTP colon slash slash: end of the road?", a remake of what I
presented at the [IPC in Mainz last year](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road),
with some more contents and - hopefully - fancier slides :-P

Cheers!
