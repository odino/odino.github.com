Today, I wave goodbye to the company I supported for the past 7 and
a half years, Namshi.

<!-- more -->

It's with mixed feeling that I write this blog post, as it's been
a hell of a ride and I recognize I was privileged to get on board
just at the right time. It is a truly
bittersweet moment to leave behind something you've dedicate so much
to, but I do feel *my time is now*: after all of these years I long for a change
of scenery, (somewhat) different challenges and new environment
to flourish in. It won't be easy to replicate what we've done over
the past years, but the least I can do is to try to spread all the
good I've experienced.

To all my teammates, I thank you for striving to make this
happen: we wouldn't have come anywhere near to where we are right now
if it wasn't for the collective team effort we put over the years.
This is a "thank you" that spans 7 years of life, so it goes to the
the current team as much as it goes to the ones who were there in
2012, when it was real wild. From the warehouse to HQ, your work
was impressive, and it's a great story in the region.

I want to take a moment to mention [the folks
in the tech team](https://tech.namshi.io/team/), as their loyalty and
effort have ignited my days for years -- if it wasn't for what
my teammates have been putting in day in and day out, I don't think
I could have lasted this long.

Among all of the positive qualities that this tech team developed,
there's one I want to call out: the **generosity** that is embedded in this team's
DNA is what is going to make me proud for years to come, as how much
each and every individual strives to help their teammates is something
I haven't experienced before. I am truly happy to say that
we are a team of great software engineers but, way before that,
great human beings.

As for myself, I will take a break, and focus on the next crazy ride
right after. I'm not planning to get back to work for at least another couple
of months, and I haven't finalized anything yet. What I can say, though,
is that I'm not planning to sit down and discuss new opportunities as I've
already done that and have shortlisted my options. I'm excited about this
ambiguity and, more importantly, I'm excited about spending my next
couple of months relaxing, recharging my batteries and waiting to see
the future unfold in front of me.

Bye folks, it's been a pleasure.
