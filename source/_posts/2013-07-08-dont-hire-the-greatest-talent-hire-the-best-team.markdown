It was summer 2010 when I was watching the dramatic
exit of Italy from the south african world cup and,
as the tournament proceeded, I anyhow enjoyed seeing
teams battling against each other for the spot #1 on
top of the ranking.

One thing that I will always remember, about that
tournament, are the statements of [Jacopo Romei](it.linkedin.com/in/jakuza),
agile coach at eBay and very good friend,
about the selfish playing style
of the Argentinian team, where a bunch of superstars
used to play. And I will never forget that, even though
they are - historically - a great team, they are very
poorly ranked among recent winners of the world cup
(2010~1009 [Spain, Italy, Brazil, France, Brazil, Germany]).

## Maximum flow

If you ever dealt with graph algorithms, you probably
bumped into [maximum flow problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem)
at least once in your life, which have very
[real-world case studies](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~lex/files/histtrpclean.pdf)
making them a pretty fascinating topic among over the plethora
of abstraction that the graph theory and its surrounding
environment is built upon.

One of the *reincarnations* of the maximum flow problem
is exactly what Jacopo used to talk about: finding the
best combination of 11 players to display on a football field
instead of finding the best 11 players ever. Another one, pretty funny,
miight be currency conversion as explained in
[Kevin Daniel Wayne's dissertation "Generalized Maximum Flow Algorithms"](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/papers/thesis.pdf) (p.15).

Long story short, the maximum flow problem stereotypes the idea
that given a network of nodes, each one with its own potential (read *rating*),
you can't rate the network based on its node's rating.

## Talent != Success

## Telecommuting?

not against but the majority ive seen dont like it

## Hire the best team
