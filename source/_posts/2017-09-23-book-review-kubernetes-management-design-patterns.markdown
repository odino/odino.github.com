Writing about an evolving piece of software such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) must
be quite of a task, and rarely gets done right.

Unfortunately, "[Kubernetes management design patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Management-Design-Patterns-Platforms/dp/148422597X)" is kind of a boring version of the official
docs, and won't offer much to k8s' *aficionados*, who already understand
a bunch of patterns around k8s deployments.

I really don't want to sound too negative, this was probably a bad buy
from my side -- I didn't even get to the end of the book
as I didn't find it interesting.
