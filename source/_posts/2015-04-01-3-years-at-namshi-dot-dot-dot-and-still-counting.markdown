Today I celebrate my third birthday at Namshi, 3 long, long
years that represent an amazing journey in my life.

There are so many moments I will remember forever, many positive ones,
few negative ones, a lot of excitement and huge growth, both
from a personal and professional perspective. There are very
few things I regret and I'm honestly proud of that.

<!-- more -->

There is one big **thank you** that goes to the people in our
team{% fn_ref 1 %}. These guys, their
passion, willingness and fighting spirit are what makes the
tech room a sweet home for me.

Instead of mentioning these crazy freaks, I'd like to look
back at the moments we spent together, wishing everone
to spend more time with each other in the years to come.

Hopefully, in a few years, I will have many more pictures
to add here :)
