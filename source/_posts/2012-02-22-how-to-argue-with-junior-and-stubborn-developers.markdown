In these days I had a nice chat with
[Önder Göğebakan](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gogebakan) to exchange
some views about **team leading**: one of the points I loved to face
was how to deal with arrogant coders that **don't want to consider
the indications received from their technical lead**.

## Pulling responsabilites is not that bad

It makes no difference the reason why the developers is going against your
opinion/advice/dictation: it may be due to inexperience or attitude, and this
is not *that* bad.

{% img right /images/rooster.jpg %}

A developer which pulls responsabilities shows a good attitude, as it
demonstrates that he wants to take a decision based on different variables
evaluated differently than you: passive coders{% fn_ref 1 %} are just a bad
smell within your organization, because they won't ever be as productive
as you might need; don't get me wrong on this: **passive developers are
a valuable asset**, as you can't rely on a team of cocks, but you
shouldn't hire too many passives, since, in a team of 4~6 people there
will be room for 1, maybe 2, washermen.

Push systems are just a bad idea: if you throw duties and responsabilities
to your developers they won't feel comfortable with them and will suddenly
fear the assigned tasks; make a developer pull his responsabilities and you
will be able to work in a strongy energized, motivated, self aware and
fast growing team{% fn_ref 2 %}.

If you will ever be in troubles when a proactive developer go against
your decision, I want to share with you a few thoughts on that.

## Use exampl...your experience

Being a CTO, team leader, technical fellow or whatever, you gained
so much experience from your previous "developer's years" that you have
an unvaluable knowledge about problem solving, and when I say
unvaluable I mean that there's no inexperienced brain that could
overcome a seasoned veteran.

Think about the way you solved that technical problem earlier in your
career and start adding examples to your cause: don't pretend to
think that this new problem "it's just the same I saw in `some company`
back in 2001", because the developer will think that your are
just scratching the surface of the issue and will look at you
with no trust.

When Michael Jordan got back into the NBA for the second time,
with the partially self-owned team of the Washington Wizards,
he was 38, and wasn't able to provide the physical strength,
speed and responsiveness that he had back on his 20s.

Although all of this, the great thing that Mike did was to **take
advantage of his experience** to overcome youger players and
rough defenders: without a fully-supporting body, he was able to
perform great games, with a
[51-points legendary performance](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200112290WAS.html)
against the Charlotte Hornets, just to mention one episode.

At 38.

Don't think your technical knowledge will be as exhaustive as
during your full-development period, but take advantage of the
situations occurred during those valuable years.

## Approach the problem from different points of view

{% img right /images/sheldon.board.jpg %}

## Make spikes

## Consolidate doubts

## Give trust, feed the monster and save him before death

fa in modo che si sentano di avere paura, ma fagli risolvere le cose da soli

## Gain trust

## Be humble and step back

se ti aaccorgi in ritardo che sbagli tu ammettilo, ti fara guadagnare rispetto e non ti mettera in cattiva luce come tiranno
