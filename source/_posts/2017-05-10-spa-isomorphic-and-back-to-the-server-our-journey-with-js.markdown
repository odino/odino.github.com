This morning I have a talk at the JsDay in Verona, describing how we went "back
to the basics" with our latest revamp of our mobile website.

<!-- more -->

My presentation was mostly focused on performance and seeing how
easy it is to combine fast servers ("10ms or less") with frontend optimization
for extremely speedy web applications.

Here are the slides of the talk:

Unfortunately I had some videos and I'm known
for giving talks that require people to be there as the slides are half of it
(tip: that's why you should come to these events!), but I think you can get the
picture.

Cheers!
