I joined [Namshi](https://www.namshi.com) when it was really small, a team of ~50
people or less -- when we didn't have our own warehouse and I had to fight to have
a fixed desk at our HQ.

It's not always been easy & simple, but today we're definitely in a better spot,
and I wanted to share some of the benefits I really like about working here. This
post isn't about what's good about our tech or anything of that sort, it's about
why I enjoy coming to work at this company, day after day, after 4 and a half
years.

We recently rolled out a series of additional benefits for all employees and I'm
going to be mainly focusing on those, as I really like the culture that HR instilled
over the past year or so.
