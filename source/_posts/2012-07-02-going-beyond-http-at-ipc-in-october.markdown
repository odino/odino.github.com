Just a quick one: seems that in October I'll need to travel
all my way back to Europe to speak at the
[international PHP Conference](http://phpconference.com/) 2012
in its winter edition.

Subject? Oh, something that I *really* love:

{% blockquote %}
For years we've been used to the HTTP protocol, one of the reasons behind the web's success, a protocol able to scale up to bilion of requests and beyond.
But there's more we can achieve, leveraging HTTP/1.1 hidden feature, taking a look at HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, the Google-proposed new protocol which is already making web faster.

Back to the basics: what enpowers and will enpower the web?
{% endblockquote %}

Still to be confirmed - flights, leave days, date - but I should be able
to make it for the first time among the germans.

Hope to see you there!
