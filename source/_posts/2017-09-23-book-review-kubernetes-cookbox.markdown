As I mentioned in my previous post,
writing about an evolving piece of software such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) must
be quite of a task, and rarely gets done right.

Just like the [book I previously "reviewed"](/book-review-kubernetes-management-design-patterns/), this doesn't get high on my list:
cookbooks are a peculiar type of books but, if innovative and addressing
interesting use-cases, could turn into masterpieces.

The [Kubernetes cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Cookbook-Hideto-Saito/dp/1785880063) isn't, in my opinion, one of those: comprised of 8
chapters, at around chapter 6 you'll learn how to deploy k8s on AWS, which
is something I would consider *chapter 1 material*.

Truth to be told, the book didn't seem extremely interesting for someone
who already got a bit of experience with k8s, but might be extremely interesting
if you are a novice. Again, probably a bad buy from my side!
