During October of the last year, me and my ex-colleague David
took some time off to partecipate to the [polish PHP Conference](http://phpcon.pl/2011/pl/)
with a talk about graph databases, OrientDB and how to integrate it
in PHP.

I recently found out that the videos recorded at the conference
finally made it to Vimeo: enjoy some tarzan english!
