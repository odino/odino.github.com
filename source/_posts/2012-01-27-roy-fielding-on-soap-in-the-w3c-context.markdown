I found an old but interesting entry in the WWW-talk mailing list:

{% blockquote Roy T. Fielding http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0235.html WWW-talk mailing list %}
The only reason SOAP remains in the W3C for standardization is because all of the other forums either rejected the concept out of hand or refused to rubber-stamp a poor implementation of a bad idea.
If this thing is going to be called Web Services, then I insist that it actually have something to do with the Web.
If not, I'd rather have the WS-I group responsible for abusing the marketplace with yet another CORBA/DCOM than have the W3C waste its effort pandering to the whims of marketing consultants.
I am not here to accommodate the requirements of mass hysteria.
