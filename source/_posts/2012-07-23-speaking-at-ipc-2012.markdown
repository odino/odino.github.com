Now it's official: in October I will be
in Mainz for [IPC 2012](http://phpconference.com/).

<!-- more -->

No doubts anymore: I will be present - for my first time -
at the most prestigious{% fn_ref 1 %} european PHP conference,
a travel more than 6 thousand kilometers long:

<iframe width="750" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FWObgQEd3exLAylFxtlqSUNfPjFiUSmEUG7mvQ%3BFZ7U-gId1dd9ACl5E98zLpG9RzGgG9sQ1dQiBA&amp;q=from+Dubai+to+Mainz&amp;aq=&amp;sll=32.93158,33.8919&amp;sspn=21.939821,46.538086&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;saddr=Dubai&amp;daddr=Mainz&amp;ll=37.0008,31.761065&amp;spn=26.13436,47.12413&amp;output=embed"></iframe>

I will bring with me a new talk{% fn_ref 2 %}, which
mainly deals with protocols:

* history of `HTTP`
* hiddent features of `HTTP/1.1`
* what should we expect from `HTTP/2.0`
* how `SPDY` is revolutionizing web protocols

If you'll be there, dont hesitate and drop me a line
at *alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com*, it will be a good
opportunity to have a chat about PHP and the
[Middle East](/moving-to-dubai/).
