After launching a couple
PHP User Groups in Italy
([Rome](http://roma.grusp.org) and [Friuli](http://friuli.grusp.org)),
I started to feel kind of lost here in
Dubai, a place that gathers together lots
of talents but doesn't have that much of
knowledge-sharing culture.

Given this and the pro-active involvement of
some of my colleagues from [Namshi](http://en-ae.namshi.com),
I really wanted to see some sort of community
raise in this desert.

<!-- more -->

So a couple weeks ago I opened a
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-user-group-dubai)
for the PHP User Group Dubai - pretty empty right now - which is the place
where we're going to discuss meetings, ask for support
and *chillax* in a nerdy way.

Yesterday we had our first meeting, where 7 of us
discussed on the directions that we should initially take to gain the attention of others in the development community and
which kind of formats to use during our meetings; the main points that came out of the meeting are:

* we will try to meet once a month
* we will try to set and prepare the next meeting before the beginning of Ramadan (~10 July)
* everyone will try to bring a new joiner (friend, colleague, etc.) to the next meeting
* we will have a talk and a discussion after that, most probably in front of a dinner accompanied by some *sheesha*
* most probably, since not everyone is aware of the potential and benefits of automated testing, we will prepare a talk on
PHPUnit

So, if you are a PHP developer based in the UAE
- not necessarily Dubai - why don't you subscribe
to our [PHP User Group Dubai google group](groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-user-group-dubai) and
introduce yourself? Do you want to understand why testing your applications manually it's a waste of your energies and of money of your company? Do you know about [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org)? Have you ever tried developing an application with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and some HTTP APIs as the backend of that app? How can you [integrate the JWS authentication mechanism in your PHP code](/securing-your-http-api-with-javascript-object-signing-and-encryption/)?

It would be great to see you at the next meeting!{% fn_ref 1 %}
