Just a heads up: I've decided to follow [a friend](https://twitter.com/cirpo)'s
advice and start cross-posting the contents of this blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/).

All new content will be published both here (I like my data!) and there, with the
goal of reaching a broader community. I also got fed up with the Disqus comments
(they mostly show freaking clickbait links) and wanted to find an alternative, so
I will be shutting down comments on my blog shortly and instead point people to
Medium.

Here's [my profile](https://medium.com/@alexnadalin) and a link to my latest
[medium-ized post](https://medium.com/@alexnadalin/unix-goodies-to-the-rescue-vol-2-5da643407561) :)
