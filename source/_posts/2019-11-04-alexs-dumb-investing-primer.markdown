Over the past few months I have discussed investing with a few people I know,
and quite a few asked me to share or explain them how do I do it, what's the
best strategy and so on.

This post tries to summarize my thoughts on investing and my (very little)
knowledge on the subject -- mostly because my standard answer has been
"oh, a few people asked me this, I should write a blog post and link y'all
to it" :)

## Disclaimer

I am in no way a professional financial advisor (not that [a certification
would make a lot of difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY&t=955s)),
so you should take my words with a bit of caution. Just like I did, do your own
research and **come up with the strategy you're mostly comfortable with** -- some
might not be able to digest risk very well (that's me), while some are fairly
ok under that type of pressure.

You're at the helm of your own wealth, so make sure you're comfortable with the
financial decisions you take. Others are not responsible for your rise or fall.

## Why investing?

In simple words, investing allows you to build wealth and achieve financial goals
that might not be possible with your 9-to-6 job. There is *so much* we can earn
by using our skills in our daily job, while investing allows you to reallocate
your earnings in instruments that will, hopefully, appreciate over time.

"Appreciate over time" is an important detail: if you don't invest, the money
you're earning right now is losing value as days go by due to a mechanism called
inflation, which I'm sure you're familiar with. To understand the numbers, the average
inflation per year over the past 60 years, in the US, has been around 3.7%, meaning
a thousand dollars earned a day could be worth $960 a year later.

40 dollars might not seem like a lot, but you should understand that, a year later, those
$960 will become $925. This will go on as long as you can think,
as rising prices are the norm (unless a major financial event takes place).

So, we've cleared something right out of the gate: holding onto your cash is
generally not a great move, as it loses value over time. Prices increase so what
you could have bought with $1000 20 years ago is very different from what you can buy
today with the same amount.

I wil say that **fighting inflation is not really the reason I invest**: sure,
thinking my money loses value as days go by isn't something I'm thrilled about,
but my fundemantal goals are very different. I invest to be able to achieve
financial indipendence and (possibly) be able to retire earlier than 65. The important thing,
in my opinion, is to define your goals and come up with a strategy to achieve those:
it could be something along the lines of "I want to have a steady passive income",
"I want to be able to pay for a very expensive college for my kids" and so on.

Understand what your main goal is, and then strategize on how to get there.

## Shall I buy real estate, invest in the stock market or what?

There is no silver bullet here. While I personally think that owning at least
one property (the one you live in) leads to a healthier, less stressful life,
I do not own very specific views towards the best investment vehicle. Some are
very intriguied by real estate, especially in exotic (eg. Dubai) or distressed
(eg. Greece) places, due to specific circumstances (high yield or low entry price).

I am somewhat biased towards owning equity in publicly traded companies, mainly due
to the fact that the entry prices to such investment is much lower than buying a piece
of real estate, and that the stock market allows to diversify more easily -- think about
wanting to buy real estate around the world: who is really going to look after all
of those moving parts? It must be a time-consuming task, while the stock market requires,
in my opinion, a lot less knowledge and effort.

Again, you make your own decision: evaluate what your circumstances are and plan
accordingly. Spoiler alert: one investment vehicle does not preclude you from
another one, so mixing up might be a very reasonable thing to do.

## The market and stock exchanges

This is where things, in my opinion, get very interesting: the stock market is such
an underappreciated concept, and its inner workings never cease to amaze me!

Long story short, a stock market allows people to buy shares of a particular company
(this is not 100% accurate but we'll get to that later). This means that, every day,
milions of people around the world wake up and decide that Microsoft is worth 1T
dollars and change, roughly $140 a share. Some of these people will then decide that
they don't want shares of Microsoft anymore, while other buy them by making offers
in the market. That's it -- long story short, the stock market is, fundamentally,
a virtual gathering of people that takes place everyday, where they trade shares of
companies.

Earlier on, only accredited investors could actually take part in the daily trades
of the market, while nowadays you can simply download robinhood and invest within
5 minutes.

A clarification: **there is no single stock market**. Various countries have markets
that allow you to invest in particular companies that are "traded" in that specific
market (or exchange). For example, the US is home to multiple exchanges such as the
NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX -- but there's [many more just there](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/security-market-usa.asp),
and a ton more [around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges).

The reason why we don't have a single market is that exchanges are generally ran by
regulated companies, and those regulations vary from country to country. In addition,
exchanges tend to be focused on equities that are very much active in their own countries:
it would make very little sense for a company like Recordati, an italian pharmaceutical
company, to be traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where most investors would be
japanese themselves. They'd be far away from the company, it would be harder for them
to research and understand the company and that would lead to a loss of value for the
company itself, as investors probably wouldn't be paying a high price for their shares.
For this reason, Recordati is traded on an italian stock exchange.

An exception to this are US stock exchanges, where loads of foreign companies
have decided to "list" their shares -- this is mostly due to the confidence investors
have in the US markets, and the fact that a ton of money is traded there. Where there's
money there's an opportunity, and so companies decide that they might better be off
being listed in an US stock exchange. Foreign companies such as Spotify or AliBaba are
examples of that.
