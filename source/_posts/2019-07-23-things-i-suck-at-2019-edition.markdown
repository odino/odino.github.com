Every now and then one of my teammates asks me "how do you know that?",
just like I'm some sort of [GAIA](https://horizonzerodawn.fandom.com/wiki/GAIA)
artificial brain out of [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn).

Truth is, I have a few years of experience on my back, I'm quite of
a curious person (try telling me something personal) and I'm an average
learner -- meaning that my professional knowledge is stuff that's been
built over a span of ~10 years and it probably took longer than for most
people.

Since my standard response has always been "I didn't know: I asked, then I did",
I thought it would be helpful to recap some of the things I suck at -- with
the hope that one day I won't suck at them as much, as they might turn out
to be useful at some point in my life.

In doing so, I hope others will
see how someone in a leadership position doesn't necessarily have to be
a super-human (I certainly am not, though there are some...): the key here is
that **you shouldn't be afraid to admit you don't know something**, as the first
step towards learning is acknowledging there's something to learn, and ask
someone who's been there before. Experience is super-helpful, and by asking
someone else who's already familiar with the matter, they can save you all the
mistakes they did while learning. Even more important: they won't judge,
as they've been there before.

Here goes the list...

## Design

I absolutely cannot create anything that is visually stunning. Hell,
I cannot create anything that's visually *decent* to be honest.

Besides the couple of combos I learned with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/),
I am an absolutely lost cause at trying to design or create something
that's visually appealing. I tried learning it, [reading about it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-developers-guide-to-web-design-for-non-designers-1f64ce28c38d/)...but
eventually what I find visually appealing is something along these lines:

*(no jokes, this is something I developed for an internal tool at [Namshi](https://www.namshi.com),
something I was actually happy with. Again, I would rate my design skills
as internal-tool worthy at best...)*


## Audio / video quality

I don't know the actual difference between 4k and 1080p -- I know the former
is supposed to be way better but don't really understand *what* makes
it "nicer".

Audio? Same exact thing -- don't ask me the difference between mp3, mp4 or
wav cause I have no idea.

*(on the other end, I am very familiar with FPS, why they're important, etc,
mostly because of having had to deal with client side development, both on web
and mobile platforms)*

## Telecommunications

I have no whatsover idea how we're talking over the phone, or how a cable TV works:
I have a decent understanding of the internet from an infrastructure's perspective
and I expect other similar media to work the same way but, truth to be told, I have no idea.

## Converting between units

I am terrible at converting between units, for example while
doing back-of-the-envelope estimations -- I get there, but I
need my time :)

1.000.000.000 bytes? Sure...ehm...kilo...then mega...then giga...yeah, 1GB!

## Recognizing Big O complexity

It's not very easi for me to realie what the big O of a function is,
especially if it's not trivial. I understand loops, additions
(eg. `n + m` and similar) and logs but the more complicated stuff
starts to fry my brain.

## Quicksort

I was never ever able to memorize quicksort: I know it involves
picking a pivot and sorting sides of the pivot but I never managed to
visualize this well in my head. When faced with sorting, I prefer
bubblesort (simpler to implement) or mergesort (when in need of efficiency).

I have other mental models working super well (eg. [DFS vs BFS explained
with a stack/queue of cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZPXfl_tUkA))
but, damn, quicksort has always eluded me.

## Networking

## The Linux kernel

## Sleep

Even though I read "[Why We Sleep](/book-review-why-we-sleep/)" I manage
my sleep terribly. I truly wish I could easily do more but I get sucked
into the internet more often than I'd like. On a daily basis, I wake up
and tell myself "Ok, today I'm gonna sleep at 10 PM", to then find myself
watching netflix or on my laptop at 1 AM.

I have troubles falling asleep and have a condition that affects my hearing
that, unfortunately, don't help with my sleep -- so it always strikes me
that I can't easily find the willpower to do better with my sleep.

## ...and much, much more!
