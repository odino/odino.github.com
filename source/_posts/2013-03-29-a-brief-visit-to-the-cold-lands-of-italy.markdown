I'm enjoying a relatively long - at least for me - 2 weeks "vacation"
back in Italy, since I was missing my friends in Rome
since **exactly** a year and the last time my parents saw me it
was 6 months ago.

<!-- more -->

Fun thing is, since I can't miss the opportunity
of getting back in touch with a few people, I will
be joining 4 tech events:

* [Codemotion](http://rome.codemotionworld.com/) - already happened, I was there on the 23rd - the conference open to
all the programming languages, in Rome
* [PHP User group Rome](http://roma.grusp.org/), a meetup that is held monthly, for one of
the user groups that I helped launching here in Italy, again in Rome, where I gave
a talk about assembling a mid-sized PHP team
* [PHP.TO.START](http://www.phptostart.it/) - happening **right now **- a yearly event for the
north-western italian PHP community, where I'll be presenting the same talk I had at
the PUG Rome
* [PHP User Group Friuli](http://friuli.grusp.org/), another meetup organized by one of the
italian PHP User Groups, where I'll be presenting an *unknown* topic (at least for now)

An **important thing**: I am actively recruiting for our company,
[Namshi](http://en-ae.namshi.com/careers/technology/), so if you
are interested in one of the open positions that we have right now
(in particular, Lead Developer and PHP Developer), feel free to approach
me if you find me at the upcoming events (in Turin and Udine).
