Today I had the opportunity to share with the
people at the [PHP.TO.START](http://www.phptostart.it/)
in Turin my 1-year experience in Namshi, one of
Rocket Internet's ventures in the Middle East.

Luckily, this was a great opportunity to meet some good
old friends and the talk went very well: of course,
the reharsal at the [PHP User Group in Rome](http://roma.grusp.org)
earlier this week was a bless.

It basically deals with the phases that I experienced
with our team in Namshi, with some spicy details on
recruiting (from looking for talents to conducting
interviews), how to **change processes to help people improving**
(and not change people to improve processes) and
a big picture on what we were able to plan and achieve
in this year together, from a technical point of view.

At the end of the talk I invited everyone interested, and
I will repeat myself here, to look for the open positions
on [our careers site](http://en-ae.namshi.com/careers/),
since we are currently hiring a Lead Developer and a
PHP Developer (a junior or an intermediate, it's more
about the approach rather than the hands-on experience).

Here are the slides of the talk, in a slightly better (and more colored)
version compared to the ones I used in Rome:
