...and the folks from the [CakeFest](http://cakefest.org/) ended up
uploading my [2nd talk at the conference](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-end-of-the-road-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco)
as well.

It was surely more difficult than my first talk (I was half sick that day)
but I hope you will be able to enjoy this as well:
