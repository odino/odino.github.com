I don't know about you but, for me, since I got VP / CXO in my designation the
amount of [cold emails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_email) I receive from salespeople at random companies has spiked
up quite substantially -- every day I need to go through countless of "*Just the
right thing to start the week*" or "*Alex, you will not regret this*", which is
quite annoying to say the least.

Fair game, though, as I can filter most of them out through amazing tools like
[SaneBox](https://www.sanebox.com/). But this week I received one of those
emails that are plain scam, blatantly unethical, and I wanted to share my
experience with you because, yes, I didn't let this one go unnoticed.

## It all started with...

{% img right /images/gcc.png %}

Background: I'm the [CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandronadalin/) of [Namshi](https://en-ae.namshi.com/), the biggest fashion-focused online retailer
in the Middle East. We operate across the [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council)
(so we're pretty tied down to the area over here) and do not have any physical store
because, well, e-commerce. Duh.

So you can imagine the surprise when I received an email with a subject that
sounded too friendly to be true:

{% img center /images/sales0.png %}

...and I'm like wow, this person's girlfriend must have shopped from us -- maybe
while on vacation, maybe they actually live down here. So I must admit I got a
little bit curious and decided to check if he had some interesting feedback about
their shopping experience. I opened the email and:

Now, again, let's focus on the first paragraph:

{% img center /images/sales2.png %}

and pretend for a second that you're me, trying to find Oxford Street on this
map:

{% img center /images/sales3.png %}

This is a portion of [Jeddah, KSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah) and yes,
I'm just screwing around. Since I'm in the mood, let's have some fun while we play:

{% img center /images/sales4.png %}

Alex, what a surprise, you're in the UK!

{% img center /images/sales5.png %}

What a coincidence, we're both on Oxford Street! (in hindsight, that "*our office is **actually** in Oxford Street*" sounds too
funny)

Anyhow, you know me, I'm so attached to work that I don't want to waste time in the
trip:

{% img center /images/sales6.png %}

So let's just confirm the address:

{% img center /images/sales7.png %}

You know what?

{% img center /images/sales8.png %}

...and you think that's it, he or she must have realized I was just screwing
around and this is just a good laugh for me. Surprisingly, I **still** get
a reply back because, hey, a true salesman never gives up:

## People, this is not cool.

This has to stop -- it's beyond annoying, beyond the follow-up emails, beyond
the distracting subjects: it's simply **unethical**.

You're lying to create a connection with a potential client, and I'm sure as hell
we would never do business with individuals (or companies) that employ such
sneaky tactics. I've been pondering whether I should reveal the identity behind
those emails, but at the end of the day it's holiday season so Santa told me
to let this one go.

Look, I understand the job's not easy, you have targets to hit and the pressure's
on, but if you cant be straight and get a client I don't know what makes you think
you're better of lying and being sneaky.
