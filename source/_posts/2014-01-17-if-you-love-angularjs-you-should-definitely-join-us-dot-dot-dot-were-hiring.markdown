In order to expand our team we are now looking for a
frontend JavaScript developer that loves Angular and wants to
drown under loads of `ng-*`, FPS optimizations and
building the frontends for our
[Service Oriented Architecture](/tips-and-tricks-for-you-service-oriented-architecture/).

If you are also interested in helping on the whole stack, here's a
summary of the rest of the technologies we're using down here at
[Namshi](http://namshi.com):

* [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/)
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

I must admit that is has been pretty exciting to get our
hands dirty with all of these (and the less attractive ones
as well :-P).

Dubai is a pretty nice place and we are **very** open
to relocations: if I'm writing this blog post it's because
I would like to reach everyone on the internet who wants
to give it a shot, and not only our connections here in
Dubai.

Namshi is a [fun workplace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NThxiu1HGgM)
and you're gonna be working with an
[highly skilled team](http://tech.namshi.com/portfolio/)
with the goal of delivering the best customer experience in
the Middle East, through a website that should ideally
render in ~100ms, powered by lotsa APIs.

So yeah, what are you waiting for? `ng-apply` now!
