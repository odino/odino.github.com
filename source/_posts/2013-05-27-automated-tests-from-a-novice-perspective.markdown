Today I got one of those moments of pride
when one of our developers, who is working
since - roughly - a year, decided to send an
email to the team after working on automated
tests for the first weeks of his career:

Automated testing is great idea 

If you have a ticket which requires a lot of changes (20 files, for example) Automated tests are very helpful and save your time, it saves about 30% of your time; even if it's still not perfect, its good
For example look at this PR [link to a PR on Github], if i want to test all cases i need about half a day but it only took half an hour
