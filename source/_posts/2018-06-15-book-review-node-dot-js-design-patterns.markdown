This is a book that was recommended to me by one of my former colleagues, but
turned out to be pretty disappointing.

[Node.js design patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Design-Patterns-Mario-Casciaro/dp/1783287314)
gives you a few interesting pointers, like a complete overview of streams or implementing
a service locator / container in Node -- but to me it feels like that most of the
topics covered in the book are either too basic or general.

I think it might be that the book is intended for a different audience, so I won't
make too many assumptions or criticize the book too much. In addition, there's
a [2nd edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition),
with an additional [author](https://twitter.com/loige?lang=en), that has come out
in 2016, so it might be that the newer edition kicks asses (the person that recommended me this read had the 2nd edition, but I
wasn't aware when I bought the book).

...if only I had known :)
