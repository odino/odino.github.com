At the end of August I will
be travelling to reach SF and
the [CakeFest](http://cakefest.org/), the annual
conference about
[CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/).

<!-- more -->

Funny thing is, I have two talks
and none of them deals with Cake, **at all** :)

I will be talking about the
evolution of Web Protocols, in
particular HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, in a
remake of the [talk I gave the IPC](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road),
in Mainz, last year.

My second talk will be a *new entry*, a
collection of tips, advices and tricks
in order to manage a SOA, learnt **the hard
way**.

If you are going to be around San Francisco
in the first days of Semptember, feel free to
ping me!
