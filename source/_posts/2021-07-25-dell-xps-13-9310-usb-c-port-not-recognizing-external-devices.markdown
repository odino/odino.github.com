description: Found a firmware bug in the new XPS, which is easily solvable with just a little bit of patience.

Just a quick one as I got back from my holidays and got taken aback
by a glitch in my XPS.

My right USB-C port stopped recognizing external devices yesterday:
it would be able to charge my laptop through the regular charger but
I couldn't get it to recognize or charge neither my airpods or phone.

After digging a little bit around the Dell support forums I found
someone having luck by just restarting the laptop (though letting it rest
for a while).

So that's exactly what I did -- turned off the laptop, let it rest
for a few hours (actually, overnight) and then turn it back on again...
...and the problem was gone. Worth to notice that I also tried shutting
it down for 1/2m and didn't work out.

I do believe this is a firmware issue, and I noticed it kicked in
by booting the laptop with a device connected to that port. Strange
world!
