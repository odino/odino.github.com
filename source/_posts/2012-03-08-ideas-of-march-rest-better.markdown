[Chris](http://shiflett.org/blog/2011/mar/ideas-of-march) just pointed out we need a blog revival, 'cause microbloggin services are just killing real blogs and really deep debates.
<!-- more -->

So I've just decided to start a series of post dealing with common misconception and tutorials about the **REST architectural style**.

Here's the topics I'm planning to cover:

* [cache](/301/rest-better-http-cache)
* the uniform interface
* scalability
* DAP & HATEOAS
* CRUD
* why should I care about REST?
* [common pitfalls](/304/rest-better-common-pitfalls)
* a RESTful architecture with Symfony2 ( dude, just don't pretend it, I'll try :-))

Since I'm a big fan of REST and since we really need deep documentation on some basics and pro-topics I hope it will help somebody.

## First step: links, man!

As a first step in this series of posts I will only give you a couple of useful links to better understand the basics of REST.

David Zuelke knows best, so give a look to his [Designing HTTP interfaces and RESTful webservices](http://www.slideshare.net/Wombert/designing-http-interfaces-and-restful-web-services-confoo11-20110310).

For those of you who didn't checked it out, you may be interested about the presentation I gave at the Codemotion ( the former italian JavaDay ), called [REST in peace](http://www.slideshare.net/odino/rest-in-peace-codemotion-2011).

If you find any typos or want to suggest something feel free to comment the presentation on slideshare or here.
