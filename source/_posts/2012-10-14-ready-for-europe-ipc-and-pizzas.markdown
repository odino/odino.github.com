In 24 hourse I'll be on a plane which is gonna bring
me in Frankfurt, to then join the [International PHP Conference](http://phpconference.com/)
in Mainz.

I'm pretty excited since this will be my first visit
to the old continent since I moved to Dubai - almost 7 months ago -
and I'm glad I'll do that for IPC, with a brief *pit-stop* in Italy -
unfortunately not in Rome.

At IPC I will talk about REST, with an - I hope -
interesting introduction about this architectural style, anti-patterns
and a few tips on how to implement REST's constraints in our
architectures.

I will also have another chance to talk, and I'm **seriously**
excited about it, since, for the first time, I get the chance to
talk about the foundation of our lives in the modern era (*homo internectus*),
the **HTTP protocol**: I will talk a little bit about why we needed it,
with some historical notion about the web's foundation, what SPDY
brings on the table and the recent **revolutions** around `HTTP/2.0`.

On the 17th evening I will catch a flight for Venice (via Wien) and then
I'll spend some time with the rest of the family, good thing if you also
consider that for the first time in 4 years they're gonna see me for my birthday.

But Italy doesn't mean that I'm going to relax **at all**, as I will
finally meet all the guys from the [PHP User Group Friuli](http://friuli.grusp.org/),
the 2nd PHP user group in Italy (considering numbers and history), that
I personally founded along with [Steve&Stefano](http://www.mvassociati.it/it/il-team) and [Daniel](http://it.linkedin.com/in/dlondero) in front of a pizza,
but never got to join during their
monthly meetings, as I was already based in Rome at that time.

There is no plan about that meeting, as the topic will be "*Alessandro Nadalin in tour*":
if you are a developer, a technology enthusiast or simply a student come
and join us in Codroipo, as I will also talk about abroad work experiences as well
as scout and recruit for some companies (yes, not only **my** company).

Cheers!
