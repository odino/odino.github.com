The first day of the [SymfonyCon Madrid](http://madrid2014.symfony.com/) is almost
over and, since I'm done with my talk, I'm gonna
take the time to - as usual - put the slides here.

<!-- more -->

My talk went (I hope) well, and I am grateful
to the guys that stopped me afterwards to
clarify some of their doubts or to have
a casual chat about Angular and other frontend-ish
things.

Here are the slides:

By the way: **110% respect** to
SensioLabs for finding a venue which:

* has great WiFi
* serves yummy food
* is 20 minutes away from a shisha place

Tomorrow it will be the second and last day
of conference; afterwards I'm gonna catch an overnight flight
to come back to my beloved Dubai:
if you are at the conference, do not hesitate
and ping me since...[we're still hiring](http://tech.namshi.com/join-us/)!
