Last year I wrote [12 posts](/archives), which makes it
a decent average of once a month.

Even though I would have liked to be able to blog more
often (and do some more public coding: there are at least
3/4 projects I have worked on without getting them far enough
to make it to github), I'm still happy
with the outcome so far -- at the end of the day this
blog still attracts a few hundred visitors a day and
I'm happy as long as I retain those numbers.

For 2017 I would like, though, to follow a different
approach while try to put in the same amount of effort,
with - hopefully - better results.

<!-- more -->

One post a month is generally easy to achieve, especially
when you aim low and publish very short pieces ([BUSTED!](http://odino.org/xyz-programming-language-sucks/)),
something I want to change by working with a different
approach:

* still try to publish 1 post a month (let's be realistic), with exceptions if there are some quick articles I'd like to share
* pick a broad topic (ie. resiliency in distributed systems)
* start working on a "schedule" at the beginning of the month, thinking what I want to cover, examples, caveats, etc so that the post is as exhaustive as possible (something like [this](https://hackernoon.com/10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7#.ucqcvhqyi))
* publish the article by the end of the month

I have noted down the list of posts I would like to blog about
in the [archives section of the blog](/archives/), so you can always get an
idea of what I'm working on -- hopefully this year I will be
able to deliver more in-depth, exhaustive, well-thought articles
to my (few) readers.

See ya!
