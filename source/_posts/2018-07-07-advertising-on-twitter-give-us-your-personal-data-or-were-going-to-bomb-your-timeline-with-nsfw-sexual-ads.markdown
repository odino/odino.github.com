A few months back I started writing on [freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@alexnadalin),
with the spirit of "giving back" to the community whatever I used to share on
[my personal blog](https://odino.org) as well.

FCC is a very interesting publication, and one of the personalities I got to
"discover" was [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia); it was by following
Quincy that I discovered I could opt-out of Twitter's ad tracking, something
that turned out to be quite of a journey.

Quincy's [pinned tweet](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1003302742717292544) is a gem:

"Amazing", I thought, let me do the same -- I would definitely like to opt out
from all those personalized ads: not because of their content, but simply because
I'd like advertisers (and Twitter) to connect fewer dots when it comes to my
interests and habits.

How beautiful was to "*Control how Twitter personalizes content and collects and shares certain data.*" --
I would never have imagined what kind of Pandora's box I had just opened.

Within a few days from opting-out, I spot a relatively "weird" tweet on my timeline:

{% img center /images/tweet-nsfw.png %}

"Ouch", I told myself, "this must the result of turning off personalized ad data":
now Twitter will just serve ads from the richest bidder, and this time it was a NSFW
one. Without jumping to conclusions, I quickly flagged the ad as not relevant, blocked
the user and moved on, thinking this isolated episode wouldn't be much of a problem.

Except that, as the weeks went by, my timeline started to look like a Hooters joint:

The ads are practically identical: a burner account
posting a link with a media and the content of the tweet being a mere "click here" --
how hard would it be for Twitter to prevent this from happening?

I'd say not so hard, and before you ask me to consider the technical implications
of such a feature, let me introduce you to [Eega Beeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_universe#Eega_Beeva), an interesting character
from the Mickey Mouse comics. "Why?", you ask -- just hold on for a second.

Now, Eega is a funny character -- a human-sort-of-figure from the future who is
very popular in the [Italian version of the comic](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Eega_Beeva):
I know of him since my dad used to buy me the Mickey Mouse comics every single week,
so I had a good understanding of the characters in the MM universe back then.

A few days ago, I saw a tweet from the Italian edition of the MM magazine that
caught my attention, as it was flagged for containing what Twitter thought it might
have been a sensitive picture:

{% img center /images/tweet-mm.png %}

> The tweet reads "A good friend from the future is the co-star of the new
> edition of #MickeyMouseSuperStar...do you like Eega Beeva? #MickeyMouseMagazine"

And, right there, I knew that this was all about: Eega Beeva does not wear anything
in the upper part of his body, so an algorithm deciding whether a tweet might contain
explicit content might have thought that because of his resemblance to a naked body,
Eega Beeva must be flagged down...   ...and this was the "*may contain sensitive material*" picture:

{% img center /images/eega-beeva-tweet.png %}

> Note that "Eega Beeva" is translated to "Eta Beta" in the Italian edition
> of the magazine

Now, Twitter, can you please tell me how the picture on the right may contain
sensitive material, but you have no problem with the one on the left?

{% img center /images/tweet-wtf.png %}

So don't tell me there's nothing Twitter can do to fix this -- it can be done,
but it might also be that they don't really care about fixing the problem, as it
would require for them to invest time and money into a part of the ad business
(being able to serve pertinent ads to users who opted out of ad tracking)
that's probably not very profitable. Who cares for those hippy, freedom-lover users!

This was a sad realization: that **when we try to protect our privacy Twitter
thinks we're clickbait material**.

That's a really, really, really sad thing for me to write.
