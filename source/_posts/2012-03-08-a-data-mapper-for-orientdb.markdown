In [DNSEE](http://www.dnsee.com/) we're getting serious about the [CMF stuff](http://www.odino.org/tags?tag=cmf).
<!-- more -->

So, next step, is to build a basic mapper for [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/).

If you want to partecipate to its development let me know it; the aim is to build a library doing the same things of Doctrine2, with annotations and so on.

Re-using LoCs of Doctrine2, of course.

The repo is on [GitHub](https://github.com/odino/Orient/tree/master/Orient), and you'll see a `Mapper` directory appear in the next days... ;-)
