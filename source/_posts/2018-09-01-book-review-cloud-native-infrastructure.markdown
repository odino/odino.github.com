This goes right into the list of [books I really wanted to like](/book-review-nodejs-high-performance/) but kind of
disappointed me.

The book is structured extremely well, so it comes out as a very enjoyable read.
One downside, though, becomes fairly evident a few chapters in:
it isn't practical at all, describes few patterns and instead focuses a lot
on processes, advices and high-level description of approaches you should follow
to embrace CN infrastructure.

I was probably expecting too much, but when I read the book's [description on the
Kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309):

> This **practical** guide shows you how to design and maintain infrastructure capable of managing the full lifecycle of these implementations.

I got fairly excited and proceeded to buy.

Again, as I mentioned the book is really nice to read -- I devoured it during my
daily commute to work, and that's something you don't expect from most technical books.
When it comes to content, though, I found it a tad repetitive and without many
real-world examples / lessons, so it felt more of an "abstract" book around
the Cloud Native ecosystem than anything else.

I would have definitely appreciated
if the last chapter, which serves as an introduction to interesting patterns
such as circuit breaking, would have gone more into details: it might have been
out of the scope of the book but would have definitely made it feel more "hands-on".

At the end of the day, Cloud Native infrastructure goes down as an introductory
guide to the CN world. Iâ€™d recommend you to read it if you just started
approaching the ecosystem.
