I know, I'm a month late, but I need to publish a report about [this amazing conference](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/) which took place in Antwerp, Belgium, in January 2011.

It has been one of my favourite conference, and the reasons for such this kind of evaluation are multiple: I try to summarize them here.

## The talks

This is probably the conference in which I did the rightest moves: almost every talk I attended impressend me so much.

Here's the list:

* **27 ways to be a better developer** by Ivo Jansch & Lorna Mitchell, a good keynote focusing on real life experience and a few commonly forgotten tips
* **Technical Debt** by Elizabeth Naramore, a really cool talk about real life approaches to technical debt
* **Project triage & recovery** by Keith Casey, about dealing with technical debt in an OS project
* **Benchmarking applications and frameworks** by Paul M. Jones, dealing with the right approach during applications benchmarks
* **Charsets and encodings** by Kore Nordmann, in which I learned a lot about a problem I've never faced but...   ...who knows...
* **XML vs The new kids on the block** by David Zuelke, a really coll comparation between XML, JSON, HTML5 and YAML, with pros and cons for all of them: contextualization was the leit-motif
* **Designing HTTP interfaces and RESTful webservices** by David Zuelke, a f****** awesome talk, and, have to say, the greatest speaker I've ever encountered
* **Geolocation and maps with PHP** by Derick Rethans, pretty boring talk about a cool topic
* **Zeta Components** by Tobias Schlitt, presenting the Apache project and giving some code examples which turned the crowd on

## The organization

Really awesome.

We had great lunches, an awesome dinner offered by Facebook and almost everyday a free bar.

:-)

The location they choose was ok and the talks organization really pleasant.

## The bowling night

I should tell a lot about that night, but I'd rather keep some details with those who were there :-)

We had free ber offered by GitHub and a bunch of bowling lanes reserved for the conference attendees.

It was also cool because at this conferences speakers tend to aggregate with theirselves: at this one we had he opportunity to bowl together.

## The italian crew

Yes, the cool guys.

I've been there with other italian fellas, and we probably were the farest guys from home (except from a few speakers ).

Really great time spent together, and I also appreciated Michelangelo Van Dam, one of the organizers, thanking us, while smoking a cigarette, for coming there.

Definitely going there in 2012.

## There is one more thing...

Cirpo's beer spill. Amazing.
