Short post for the day to address an hopefully even shorter-lived situation
we're all in.

<!-- more -->

I've decided to make the WASEC book free, on LeanPub, for the time being.
During these uncertain times, folks might find themselves home from their
jobs or, even worse, having to deal with the loss of their livelihood.

If you, like many others, are facing uncertain times and would want
to spend time learning and educating yourself on the topic of web application
security feel free to [have one on me](https://leanpub.com/wasec).

### Update: 7th June 2020

The book is now back on sale for $9.99, as anticipated by my
[tweet](https://twitter.com/_odino_/status/1264926721050136583).
In line with my original announcement, I want to provide a path
for those who cannot afford the book, so feel free to
[get in touch if unable to pay](/wasec-a-book-about-web-application-security-is-now-available-for-sale/#what-if-i-canâ€™t-afford-the-book).
