This is the story of how Netflix is really
trying to be funny...no, super-funny!

<!-- more -->

I've ran a Netflix account for quite some
time but, after moving from Rome to Dubai
I stopped using the service as it would mean
using a VPN and stuff like that which is quite
against my principle of keeping things simple.

In the past months, while checking the statements
from my italian bank, I noticed that Netflix
kept billing me (cool), so I decided to try unsubscribing
from here, which turned out to be impossible.

Since I forgot my password, I tried recovering it:

Ok, no worries -- it might be that I used another email!

A quick look into my inbox revealed that I was
going to face hard times:

I used my regular email but still, Netflix
was refusing to let me in from their global
website. Could it be that their customer DB is
a bit messed up? Maybe if I go for the social
login I'll be able to get into my account:

Should have never tried this one, ya? It amazes me
how they cannot even provide complete error
messages.

So here I am, unable to unsubscribe from a service
I am not using anymore; the only reasonable thing
was to try reaching out to these guys and ask them
what to do: I did that [once](https://twitter.com/_odino_/status/468734390537687040),
then a [second time](https://twitter.com/_odino_/status/465149059691339776) and,
just to be sure, I tried it [a couple months ago](https://twitter.com/_odino_/status/528982644688564225) as well.

All attempts went unheard: it was clear by now that
**Netflix didn't really seem to care that much**.

Luckily, the credit card I used to sign up expired
this month and Netflix could not charge me anymore.

That meant receiving one of the most sarcastic emails
ever:

No, Netflix, **you** have a problem.
