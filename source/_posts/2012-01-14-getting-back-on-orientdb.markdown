It's been a while since I don't give any update about
[Orient](https://github.com/congow/Orient),
the library we are developing to work with
[OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm)
in PHP...
<!-- more -->

...so here's a brief recap:

* [Daniele](https://twitter.com/#!/jol1hahn) has joined the team, with some great
 brand new ideas ( the adoption, for example, of
[Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer); I will blog later on this )
* I am personally taking care of finishing the open issues ( mostly integration tests )
for the `beta-5` release, the one introducing **objects hydration**
* [David](http://davidfunaro.com/) is leading the moves for the `beta-6` release, 
which is the last one before going RC, introducing **persistence** into the
[data mapper](https://github.com/congow/Orient/tree/master/src/Congow/Orient/ODM)

Uh, well, [happy 2012](http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/Y2011): this year we
 will see some great things from OrientDB and its ecosystem!
