As announced on twitter a few days back, it seems
that the time has come for me to step up and start
dealing with printed paper.

<!-- more -->

It's not something I've never talked about,
and especially in the last 9 months I wanted
to start something towards this direction - 
my draft of 
[REST webservices in PHP](https://leanpub.com/rest-webservices-php)
is still there ideed.

At the same time, even though self-publishing
is easier and provides good motivation at first,
**is not very attractive on the long run**,
for both the author and the reader: yes, you
get to reach a wide audience, yes, they can
learn in a really cheap way{% fn_ref 1 %},
but writing a **real** book is way different.
It's a statement, a printed statement: it is
**just different**.

The chance has come quite quickly, as I will be
**co-author** of a book by 
[Manning Publications Co.](http://www.manning.com/),
which is a very important editor when it comes to
the language with the J.

Isn't it strange? I am a seasoned lead developer
on the LAMP stack but I will write a book dealing with a tool
that has something to do with Java: there a reason,
of course, behind this.

And probably you have already guessed it.

Long story short, [Luca Garulli](http://www.linkedin.com/in/garulli){% fn_ref 2 %},
the brilliant mind who gave
OrientDB, a sensational document-graph database, to the world, needed 
some more fat fingers helping him for the first ever
book on the topic, and being directly connected to Luca
- as he used to work with my previous CTO, 
[Alex](http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlombardi), we
both attended the 2011 NoSQL Day and we've spent
some time together when I was living in Rome -
made us decide to try to make it together: I feel we
are a perfect match, given my *youngsta* passion and his
endless commitment to his baby.

Fact is that {" OrientDB is not just a NoSQL graphDB, it is a brand new way to think about storage engines "} in 2012 , when we already proved that relational databases won't fit all the scenarios out there,
that [document DBs over HTTP](http://couchdb.apache.org/)
aren't a long-term solution and that we live in a world
where **linked data is a first class citizen in our lives**,
not just somewhere in the internets.

Our challenge is to evangelize this new frontier for
data storage: I'm sure it will be a long but succesfull
way.
