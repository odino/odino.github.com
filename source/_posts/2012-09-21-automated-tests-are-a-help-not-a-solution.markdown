As I've been mainly involved in the PHP ecosystem,
in the past 5 years, I saw some deep changes in it,
from being a bunch of cowboy coders to getting
more Java-like than ever: even though the language
itself would never be able to look like Java (
luckily, I'd say) developers and vendors decided
that it was time to change application development
in PHP, providing tools (ie. PHPUnit, Zend Framework, Symfony2)
and practices (TDD) to make PHP
look way more cool.
<!-- more -->

The drawback of this is that PHP developers become pretty
spoiled in a few years: from *let's-deploy-and-hope-it's-gonna-work*
we came to the point that everyone is advocating automated
testing, continuos integration and deployment.

As always, people like to think that **one size fits all**.

## Deal with the market

## I'll tell you one truth

## Automated tests are a practice, not your goal
