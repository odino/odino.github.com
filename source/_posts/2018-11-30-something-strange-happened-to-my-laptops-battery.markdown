description: "The tale of how I supercharged my battery without knowing how to."

A few weeks ago I got to the office and noticed something
peculiar: my XPS' battery had around 7 remaining hours
of life, while until the week earlier I had never seen it above 3 hours.

This is the (very short) story of how I supercharged my
laptop's battery without even knowing how to.

## A bit of background

Last month I flew to the most beautiful continent in
the world with the idea of spending a whole week doing safaris in
Tanzania's national parks.

Suffice to say I wasn't super excited about bringing
my laptop with me, mainly because:

* I'd be on a jeep the whole time, and carrying it with me would
make no sense, since I'd just put it under a lot of stress
* I spent most of my nights at a camp that did not have any
internet access at all, so good luck getting online regardless

Eventually, I decided to leave the laptop at home, something
I hadn't done since a few years. Gone for a good week...

Once I got home, I noticed something interesting:
the light that signals the battery level is low was blinking --
"probably got drained over the week", I thought.

Plugged in my charger, waited until the laptop was fully
charged, then the miracle happened: since then,
the battery life has been extended by 3/4 hours at least
(you might think that's not crazy, but for a battery that
used to give me 3/4 hours of love at most, being able to do 6/8 hours
in a row is a blessing).

## How did this happen?

Frankly, I do not know. I've always been a big believer of letting the
battery work "at full capacity", meaning that I let it drain as much as
possible before charging it until it's completely full.

I think this week-long draining session, without small charges
in between, has allowed the battery to calibrate (?) better,
or *god-knows-what*. Right now, being left with 20% of battery
means I can still go on for a couple of hours:

All I know is that I have a better battery, and I owe it to
going on a vacation and being able to "disconnect". Probably, the underlying lesson is that it's good to disconnect once a year :)

Adios!
