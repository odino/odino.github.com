For $2.99 you surely can't complain:
this book certainly offers what you're
looking for.

It's a very brief *dossier* on everything you possibly
need to know about equity and stock options, or, I
better say, it's everything you need to know **unless
you need an expert's view on the topic**.

It will take you less than an hour to read and
is definitely **more helpful to startup** employees or people,
like me, who want a bit more technical background on
the subject{% fn_ref 1 %}.

The verdict? Well, I would highly recommend it for people
who would like to have a brief, "technical" overview on
the subject.

Again, it's [$2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Stock-Options-David-Weekly-ebook/dp/B0055PQ4H8) :)
