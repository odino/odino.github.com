{% img right /images/alex.jpg Me as of 2011 %}

I am a seasoned technical leader who pays a lot of attention to enterprise patterns, methodologies, communities and (everyone’s) personal development: with 6 years of experience on my back, I’ve heavily focused my attention to [agile practices](http://agilemanifesto.org/) (especially [extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)), [patterns of enterprise application architecture](http://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) and leading mid/big-sized development teams.

I’m currently in Dubai, where I work as VP Technology for [Namshi](http://namshi.com), a [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de) venture, trying to teach the team and push them towards enterprise applications development and new practices, like BDD: I am very proud of the achievements we reached in 1 and a half years working together, since we moved to a SOA using the best of the market (ie. AngularJS, [Symfony2](http://www.symfony.com), SaltStack, automated testing, RabbitMQ) and the cloud (AWS), helping our team members understanding new tools and practices they have never seen before, being still able to deliver new deployments a few times a week.

I love to share my experience and
thoughts with colleagues as much as I like to 
[talk across many events](/conferences) and
contribute to some open source projects: the most important of them is
[doctrine\orientdb-odm](http://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm), which is a **Data Mapper for OrientDB**
written in PHP, which I started to write in 2011 and got to gain some attention.

Technically speaking, I’m a big supporter of **Service Oriented Architectures**, the **REST** architectural style, asynchronous messaging systems and I’m used to work with some practices of extreme programming (and agile development, in general), like TDD, pair-programming and so on.

I firmly believe in the value of evangelization and the community as the de-facto most efficient way to help people develop themselves into better professionals: that’s why I like to travel around the globe to share my experience at conferences and I am helping others developing the first communities here in the region.

I’ve been involved in projects for governments, Samsung, Nissan, ENI and pioneered the e-commerce ecosystem in the Middle East: when I’m not working, you can find me speaking at some conference around the world, riding my motorcycle, blogging or eating some indonesian food in the old side of Dubai.
