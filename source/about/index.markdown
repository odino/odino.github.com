I like to play with the [Symfony framework](http://www.symfony.com), 
[OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/) and 
[extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/).

Far from being a real (or decent) coach, I love to share my experience and thoughts about **agile development** with colleagues as much as I love being attendee or speaker at some conferences across both Italy and Europe.

I like being involved in discussions about (web)architectures design, and I evangelize the **REST architectural style**.

I'm currently living in [Rome](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=roma+via+dei+prati+fiscali&hl=en&sll=41.89052,12.494249&sspn=0.913949,2.113495&vpsrc=0&hnear=Via+dei+Prati+Fiscali,+Roma,+Italy&t=m&z=16) 
where I am employed for *Interactive Thinking s.r.l*, also known as [DNSEE](http://www.dnsee.com).
