{% img right /images/alex.jpg Me as of 2011 %}

I'm currently living in
Dubai where I am permanently employed by [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de) for its venture [Namshi](http://namshi.com), as a lead developer.

I like to play with the [Symfony framework](http://www.symfony.com), 
[OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/),
[extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)
and being involved in discussions about (web)architectures design, and I
evangelize the **REST architectural style**.

I love to share my experience and
thoughts about **agile development** with colleagues as much as I like to 
[talk across many events](conferences) and
contribute to some open source projects: the most important of them is
[doctrine\orientdb-odm](http://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm), which is a **Data Mapper for OrientDB**
written in PHP, which I started to write in 2011 and got to gain some attention.

If you want to get in touch with me, write a few lines to
`alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com`.
