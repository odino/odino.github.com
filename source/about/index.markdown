{% img right /images/alex.jpg 300 Me as of 2011 %}

I am a seasoned technical leader who pays a lot of attention 
to enterprise patterns, methodologies, communities and (everyone's) 
personal development: with 7 years of experience on my back, I've 
heavily focused my attention to [agile practices](http://agilemanifesto.org/),
[patterns of enterprise application architecture](http://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html)
and leading mid/big-sized development teams.

I am a forward-thinker by nature and I still love to get my hands 
dirty with code, or testing new platforms.

I'm currently in Dubai, where I work as VP Technology for [Namshi](http://namshi.com), 
a [Rocket Internet](http://www.rocket-internet.de) venture, trying to teach the team and push them 
towards enterprise applications development and new practices while
developing distributed, stateless systems within our Service-Oriented 
Architecture: I am very proud of the achievements we reached in the 
past 3 years together, since we refactored our platform to become a 
SOA using the best of the market (ie. NodeJS, Docker, AngularJS, 
Symfony2, SaltStack, Redis, RabbitMQ) and the cloud (AWS & CloudAMQP 
among others), helping our team members understand new tools and 
practices they have never seen before (like BDD, microservices or 
12-factor apps) and still being able to deploy multiple times a
day.

I'm a big supporter of **Service-Oriented Architectures**, the **REST**
architectural style, asynchronous messaging systems and I'm
used to work with some practices of extreme  programming 
(and agile development, in general), like TDD and 
pair-programming.

Still able to find time to hack, lately I have also developed expertise
in [NodeJS and JavaScript in general](https://www.npmjs.com/~odino)
after a career spent on PHP-based architectures and software
design at large.

I have been involved in projects for governments, mainstream companies
such as Samsung or Nissan and pioneered the technology scene of
e-commerce platforms in the Middle East: when I'm not working, you
can find me [speaking at some conference](/conferences/) (I like to travel around the
globe to share my experience at conferences and to hear about new and
disruptive technologies / platforms), blogging or grabbing a bite
in the old side of Dubai.

I always try to make a positive impact in the organizations I
work at, both from a technical and interpersonal perspective;
some of the feedback that I received includes:


> I have been privileged to have good managers but Alex stands above.
> He is one of the most complete leaders I have seen. His attributes
> are countless from unique ways of motivating the team to being a
> great communicator. His unique way of delegating tasks as well
> giving the team the flexibility is incomparable. As VP, he still
> likes to get his hands dirty with codes. Its a great joy and pride
> to be working with him.
>
> **Oluwaseun Obajobi, Lead system administrator @ Namshi (2014)**

> I can't even imagine how Namshi and its development team would look
> like if we did not hire Alessandro as Lead Developer.
> It is like with Samuel L. Jackson and Pulp Fiction which cannot
> be described without one another. I can by far tell that Alex is
> my best hire at Namshi and Rocket Internet. He has been super
> involved and helpful in establishing the development team's spirit.
> Coming from a strong and cutting-edge open source expertise he shares
> and more often owns the understanding of how Namshi's technology
> should look like in the future. Being an outstanding developer from
> the beginning, he progressively took more responsibility to the extent
> that with my leaving in the next weeks, he can take over almost all
> responsibilities seamlessly which I appreciate a lot. 
>
> **Halil Koklu, former CTO @ Namshi (2013)**

> Alex is one of the best programmers I ever met, His approach to solving 
> OOP problems is incredible. Hungry of knowledge, he's able to apply 
> concept that he just learned and has excellent analysis even in cases 
> of high stress. 
> The experience he managed to gain - despite his youg age - is amazing. 
> It was a pleasure working with him especially on open source projects,
> I hope that in  the future there will be another team in which we can work
> together.
>
> **David Funaro, Sr. software engineer @ Dnsee (2012)**

> Alessandro has been my source of knowledge and inspiration in the last 
> two years. He is a person full of passion and he knows how to make you
> want to learn, or increase it. 
> Although young he has a very deeply knowledge of everything related 
> to software architecture and development processes. He's able to convey 
> knowledge only staying by his side. 
> I'm really glad to met him and have had the pleasure to work together. 
> He's always in the forefront of everything related to programming. 
> I really hope to work side by side with him again.

> **Fabio Cicerchia, software engineer @ Dnsee (2012)**

Last but not least, I am an Open Source enthusiast and I try to
release code as soon as I get the chance to, either in my
[spare time](https://github.com/odino) or while working on
some interesting projects [at the office](https://github.com/namshi).

I am usually very open to random people hitting my inbox, so feel
free to drop me a line at `alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com`!
