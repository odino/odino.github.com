<div class="entry-content"><p>So, as you might know, the last week I&rsquo;ve been in Zurich in order to partecipate to the Jazoon Rookie Award.</p>

<h2>The city</h2>

<p>Zurich, gotta say, is a really nice city: it has a lot of green and its quite clean: as Lukas told me, it&rsquo;s not because Swiss people are that respectful, but because the public administration hires lots of scavengers :)</p>

<p>Switzerland is also soooooooooo expensive, and, by the way, my hotel was in what they call &ldquo;the gold coast of Zurich&rdquo;, the richest part of the city, so as I ordered a plate of ananas at a vegetarian restaurant, I was traumatized when paying: 30 euros or something like that ( note for the me of the future: remember before the departure&rsquo;s flight that Switzerland is not in the UE, so they don&rsquo;t have euros ).</p>

<h2>The conference</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/jazoon3.jpg"></p>

<p>The Jazoon was pretty awesome: I had the opportunity to meet a lot of funny people and we had great time playing at the table-soccer or just chatting about the current state of sw lifecycles and other nerdy stuff.</p>

<p>The organization was really good, because at the hotel everyone knew about our arrival and the conference was easy to reach, with a perfect wi-fi connection and some recreative areas.</p>

<p>And, since I am italian I need to say it, the food was really tasty :)</p>

<h2>The award</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/jazoon4.jpg"></p>

<p>Oh, man, a really really really great experience.</p>

<p>I competed against Benjamin from Karlsruhe and Ivo from Skopje, 2 really cool guys that had really good presentations.</p>

<p>I ranked 2nd with my &ldquo;REST in peace: a handbook of software waste&rdquo; and won a Lenovo IdeaPad which is, basically&hellip; awesome :)</p>

<h2>Many thanks to&hellip;</h2>

<p>The other 2 rookies, we had a few beers and funny moments together, it was well-spent time with those guys.</p>

<p>And, obviously, a particular thank you to Georgios ( I hope the name is ok, George! ), Ivo&rsquo;s mentor &ndash; as far as I understood &ndash; a really nice person to chat with: we had a few moments to talk and it was really nice to have the opportunity to listen the point of view of such a wise and experienced guy.</p>

<p>Last but not least, a really big &ldquo;thank you!&rdquo; to Felix, Jutta and Marco from the organization, it was a pleasure to be invited at such this kind of conference.</p>

<h2>My presentation</h2>

<p>As usual, I post here the presentation, but you can find it on slideshare:</p>
