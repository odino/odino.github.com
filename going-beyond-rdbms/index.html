<p>We&rsquo;ve recently been looking at some of the features
of OrientDB, but what about understanding why there has
been so much spark in the NoSQL ecosystem over the past
5 years?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Data structures</h2>

<p>When comparing NoSQL solutions with traditional RDBMS,
we can generally identify a few features that are present
in most of the NoSQL storage engines.</p>

<p>For instance, they usually treat objects in their very
own way: when we look at RDBMS, objects are usually
represented as rows in a “cluster” (table), and the
cluster &ndash; by definition &ndash; includes elements with similar
characteristics (properties, or “columns”).</p>

<p>An object, in a typical relational database, fits in this
kind of structure:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/relational-object.png"></p>

<p>and, for example, here’s how you would represent a certain
type of objects, let’s say a “dog”:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/dog-object.png"></p>

<p>Even though this model, made by types (or clusters, or “tables”)
and properties (“columns”) is really popular, there are certain
scenarios in which data won&rsquo;t fit that well in those fixed
structures.</p>

<p>If we take a look at how Redis, a NoSQL key-value storage engine,
organizes data instead, we would discover a totally opposite model,
as it stores records in key-value pairs for the sake of
performances: given this simple model, storing and retrieving
data is very straightforward and, moreover, fast.</p>

<p>The question is, how would our dog record look into this new context?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/dog-redis.png"></p>

<p>It is obvious that <strong>representing a structured object in a key-value
engine seems very counter-intuitive</strong>, but as we said as the beginning
of this chapter, it is a matter of context and requirements;
a few would use Redis to store this kind of structured objects,
if the application runs well, with good performances, on a RDBMS.</p>

<p><a href="http://antirez.com/latest/0">Salvatore Sanfilippo</a>, the creator of Redis, developed this tool
while working at a <a href="https://github.com/antirez/lloogg#why-we-closed">real-time data analytics platform</a>, a tool similar
to Google Analytics when GA did not have real-time statistics: given
this context, of high-performances and weak data interconnection,
could Redis be a good solution?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/redis-context.png"></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='so, definitely, Redis has its own scenarios, and
representing data as rows would bring no added value in those contexts'>
As you see in the image above, keys could represent unique identifiers
for a webpage, while values would be the pageviews or simultaneous users
for the given page: so, definitely, Redis has its own scenarios, and
representing data as rows would bring no added value in those contexts.
</span></p>

<p>Another data representation mechanism, different from the traditional rows
or key-value pairs, is the document model, which OrientDB embraces: databases
using this model organize objects as “documents”, which have the peculiarity
of self-containing their very own properties that might differ from document
to document, even if they belong to the same &ldquo;class&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For example, you may want to offer an animal-comparison service, and you need
to store different types of animals in your database:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/animal-documents.png"></p>

<p>As you see, even though the record belong to the same family (animals), they
don’t share the same attributes: they are both documents, of the same class
(<code>Animal</code>), with their own attributes; documents give you the flexibility
in structuring data without the compromise of first designing your database
and then discover that your data does not fit in a common pattern.</p>

<p>OrientDB takes advatage of this model,  handling records as documents, as
you don’t have to declare a pre-defined structure for your data, and as a
lot of document databases it can embed documents inside other documents:
as you see in the image below, the dog document has an embedded record,
which contains informations about the home country of that specific dog<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/orient-101/dog-france.png"></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Realizing that data can be structured in different ways according to our
requirements is the key'>
Realizing that data can be structured in different ways according to our
requirements is the key to understand the choices that the creators of
most of the NoSQL databases made to make their products a valuable
alternative to traditional RDBMS: since storing data is subject to
different patterns, it should come as no news the fact that <strong>one of the
biggest advantages of these engine is being non-relational</strong>.
</span></p>

<p>While this might come as no surprise, we would instead need to dig deep
into the reason that pushed engineers towards developing these kind of
solutions: given that the most limpid advantage that NoSQL engines bring
while compared to RDBMS is their speed and flexibility, it might not sound
strange that RDBMS&#8217; most important feature &ndash; being relational &ndash; is also the
biggest constriction that relational databases have.</p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>Since we are analyzing how OrientDB, being a NoSQL storage engine, differs from
traditional RDBMS, we also need to consider the protocols that you would use to
interact with it: a trend that NoSQL databases contributed to launch is to
<strong>support different interfaces for interacting with the DB</strong> itself; for example
CouchDB, a document database written in Erlang, was a pioneer in offering a
REST interface to manage data.</p>

<p>OrientDB isn’t different as it support 2 different protocols indeed: one is
its own proprietary binary protocol, the other one is the universal and
very popular HTTP protocol; to interact with OrientDB we can decide either
to bind it with its own protocol or to manage data from OrientDB’s HTTP/REST
interface, which is, of course, very easy to understand and interact with.</p>

<p>And guess what, who of you would have thought that <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/09/MySQL-REST">MySQL would add
an HTTP interface</a>
these days? Sounds weird, right?</p>

<h2>Where to go now?</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the NoSQL world gives a certain type of flexibility that
would be impossible to achieve with traditional engines'>
At this point, it should be clear why we are analyzing a different way to
storing data, as the NoSQL world gives a certain type of flexibility that
would be impossible to achieve with traditional engines; at the same time
we’ve also seen how OrientDB fully-embraces this new model and a question
arises: is OrientDB just like any other NoSQL database?
</span></p>

<p>The answer, pretty trivial, is no, and I will try to cover this topic
in the next post of the series.</p>
