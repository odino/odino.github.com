<h1 class="center">About</h1>

</header>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/alex.jpg" title="Me as of 2011" ></p>

<p>I am a seasoned technical leader who pays a lot of attention to enterprise patterns, methodologies, communities and (everyone’s) personal development: with 6 years of experience on my back, I’ve heavily focused my attention to <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile practices</a> (especially <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">extreme programming</a>), <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html">patterns of enterprise application architecture</a> and leading mid/big-sized development teams.</p>

<p>I’m currently in Dubai, where I work as VP Technology for <a href="http://namshi.com">Namshi</a>, a <a href="http://www.rocket-internet.de">Rocket Internet</a> venture, trying to teach the team and push them towards enterprise applications development and new practices, like BDD: I am very proud of the achievements we reached in 1 and a half years working together, since we moved to a SOA using the best of the market (ie. AngularJS, <a href="http://www.symfony.com">Symfony2</a>, SaltStack, automated testing, RabbitMQ) and the cloud (AWS), helping our team members understanding new tools and practices they have never seen before, being still able to deliver new deployments a few times a week.</p>

<p>I love to share my experience and
thoughts with colleagues as much as I like to
<a href="/conferences">talk across many events</a> and
contribute to some open source projects: the most important of them is
<a href="http://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm">doctrine\orientdb-odm</a>, which is a <strong>Data Mapper for OrientDB</strong>
written in PHP, which I started to write in 2011 and got to gain some attention.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, I’m a big supporter of <strong>Service Oriented Architectures</strong>, the <strong>REST</strong> architectural style, asynchronous messaging systems and I’m used to work with some practices of extreme programming (and agile development, in general), like TDD, pair-programming and so on.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in the value of evangelization and the community as the de-facto most efficient way to help people develop themselves into better professionals: that’s why I like to travel around the globe to share my experience at conferences and I am helping others developing the first communities here in the region.</p>

<p>I’ve been involved in projects for governments, Samsung, Nissan, ENI and pioneered the e-commerce ecosystem in the Middle East: when I’m not working, you can find me speaking at some conference around the world, riding my motorcycle, blogging or eating some indonesian food in the old side of Dubai.</p>
