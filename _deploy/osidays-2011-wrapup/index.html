<h2>One hour of TDD: from saying hello to PHPUnit to mocking objects</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/osidays.jpg"></p>

<p>With my first talk I&rsquo;ve messed a few things up: as I was plugging the VGA adapter to my laptop, the native screen was loosing signal so I needed to do my session with <a href="http://blog.bastian-feder.de/blog.html">Bastian</a>&rsquo;s laptop (dude, you saved my ass).</p>

<p>The session went pretty well:  I gotta confess that I was a bit scared of showing some real-world code examples, step by step, in a live session, so the audience probably felt my preoccupation&hellip; after all, the talk quickly took the right direction, and I was able to show the <strong>implementation of the Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm in PHP with test-driven development</strong>.</p>

<p>The presentation is on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/got-units-osidays">slideshare</a> and you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/odino/osidays">repository on github</a> (slides/code without code/slides are useless).</p>

<h2>RESTful architectures</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/osidays2.jpg"></p>

<p>Oh, that was easy.</p>

<p>Not trying to sound arrogant, but this is probably the 8th time I give this presentation, so I&rsquo;m pretty used to deliver it.</p>

<p>This edition of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/rest-in-peace-osidays-2011-india-11212011">REST in peace</a> is already on slideshare, and it contains a few new things from the other, older, presentations: if you followed me during this months of <em>RESTvangelization</em> you&rsquo;ll notice that a few concepts are getting more and more important, like having durable services and taking advantage of the greatest REST architecture, the Web.</p>

<p>The <strong>presentation went well</strong> and a few people actually came after the talk for <strong>having some insights</strong> about implementing a reverse proxy in their architectures and so on&hellip;   &hellip;a rails guy even told me we was revisiting his opinion of RoR-powered APIs now :)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/osidays3.jpg"></p>

<p>I was pretty disappointed by the number of people attending the session (~50) but, from what I saw, it was really complex, for the majority of the attendees, to <strong>understand concepts like evolvability and durability</strong> in a country like India, which is the greatest place in the world to outsource <strong>quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty software</strong> ( I hope they&rsquo;re fixing it with this conferences and getting a better <em>forma mentis</em> from the software development point of view ).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/osidays4.jpg"></p>

<p>The organization
Wow, one of the coolest aspects of the conference: they have been able to satisfy every need we had, from transportation to eating, via relaxing in a wonderful hotel.</p>

<h2>Other talks</h2>

<p>I attended a few sessions from other eurospeakers like <a href="http://www.hugohamon.com/en">Hugo Hamon</a>, <a href="http://blog.bastian-feder.de/blog.html">Bastian Feder</a> and the <em>evergreen</em> <a href="http://schlitt.info/.html">Tobias</a>: although I basically knew any concept presented there, I felt how those presentations were needed by the audience here at OSIDays, &lsquo;cause they are living the moment that PHP was living 6 years ago.</p>

<p>The point is that when you need to write crappy code, that should be production-ready in 48 hours, you don&rsquo;t test anything, you don&rsquo;t decouple anything, you don&rsquo;t design anything: programmers are now forced to work in this way, and the most proficient ones get hired by great companies like IBM or whatever major.</p>

<p>Participating at these conference should make the average indian developer aware of the fact that he has a possibility: to leverage his skills and try to build complex system, not only outsourced stuff.</p>

<p>I think this is a pretty difficult topic, because only a few of them had a real-world experience on what we call <em>ordinary</em> projects: without seeing them, they think that the procedural and messy way they have is a good compromise to get the job done.</p>

<h2>And now?</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/osidays5.jpg"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t talk about my personal life in this blog, so I will not tell you how things went from this point of view: let&rsquo;s just says that now I have 3 free days for visiting a few cities here in the southern part of India&hellip;   &hellip;let&rsquo;s hope they will be amazing as a few moments here in Bengaluru.</p>
