<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m home after the <a href="http://www.nosqlday.it/">NoSQL day</a> in Brescia, a great community-driven event, that I will recap on the next post: since I went to Brescia by train ( 4 + 4 hours ) I had the opportunity, after 20 days on intense love for this book, to finish it, so I publish my thoughts about.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/rip.jpg"></p>

<p>I decided to buy this book because of its subtitle, <strong>hypermedia and system architectures</strong>, since I&rsquo;m exploring the world of media types, hypermedia formats and how they improve semantics and evolvability, I was wondering if it could gave me a good overview about the right implementation of hypermedia-driven services.</p>

<h2>Richardson maturity model</h2>

<p>This book has a great start, driving you from level 0 to 3 of the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">Richardson Maturity Model</a>: you&rsquo;ll be guided from writing an HTTP-tunneling service to an hypermedia-driven one, with the intermediate of an HTTP-loving CRUD.</p>

<p>These are fundamental steps because you will basically climb a mountain discovering:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to write an HTTP-tunnel</li>
<li>how to write a better HTTP tunnel</li>
<li>how an HTTP-loving CRUD works</li>
<li>how to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">hypermedia tenet</a> in your services</li>
</ul>


<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>An entire chapter was dedicated on <a href="http://www.odino.org/301/rest-better-http-cache">caching strategies</a>, in order to explain how to scale well from this point of view.</p>

<p>Starting from the explicit admission of <strong>WWW&rsquo;s weak consistency</strong>, the book guides you through HTTP&rsquo;s cache specification and how to correctly implement HTTP&rsquo;s cache on your system: it deserves a mention the fact that the authors explained really well why <strong>cache invalidation is bad for the web</strong> ( invalidation assumed that the server should know the state of N clients ).</p>

<h2>AtomMix</h2>

<p>In the middle of this, the book starts to tightly couple with the Atom format and the AtomPub publishing protocol: it explains very well how to use Atom as a flexible and extensible format, and AtomPub to re-use a common but valid workflow for your Domain Application Protocol.</p>

<h2>A soft end</h2>

<p>The last chapters are both interesting and soft to read: they deal with web security, semantics, <strong>SOAP</strong> and the <strong>WS-* world</strong>.</p>

<p>I really liked how it compares web oriented architectures to SOAP and WS, because it doesn&rsquo;t yell at anyone and doesn&rsquo;t blame ( too much :-P ) that world.</p>

<p>Security chapter deals with the OpenID and OAuth protocols but didn&rsquo;t really convinced me: I&rsquo;m probably not so well documented about them to get into what the book tried to explain; semantics was a great chapter instead: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language">OWL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> are well integrated with the code you previously built.</p>

<h2>Is it the right book for me?</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about REST, you probably need it: it explains very well how ( and <strong>why</strong> ) to implement a semantic hypermedia-driven service from nOOb to master. There&rsquo;s so much theory that you will find it really explanatory.</p>

<p>If you know this architectural style but want to get deeper into it, like me, the book won&rsquo;t disappoint you too: I lacked at security and semantics and was courious about authors&#8217; vision about hypermedia, so this book was really helpful to me.</p>

<p>There are a lot of code examples, in both .NET and Java ( I scrolled some pages really fast :) ), so you won&rsquo;t miss <em>that</em> part.</p>
