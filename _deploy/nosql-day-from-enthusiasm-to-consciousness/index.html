<p>The <a href="http://www.nosqlday.it/">NoSQL day</a> has been an amazing 1-day/1-track conference held in Brescia, Italy, yesterday.</p>

<p>I went there because in <a href="http://www.dnsee.com/">DNSEE</a> we are facing huge problems with the design of a software in which we thought MySQL would fit without many matters: so, given that non-relational databases are getting very popular, me and <a href="http://www.davidfunaro.com/">David</a> decided we should attend this event.</p>

<h2>What we had, have, will have and how we use them</h2>

<p>The event starts with the keynote of Gabriele Lana, which briefly explains the history of the DB as we know it.</p>

<p>Luca Bonmasser continues explaining (No)SQL antipatterns: the session was great, because it highlighted tons of use-cases which we solve with the relational model but don&#8217;t need it; we basically add to a complex and heavy-constrained system data that should not belong to that domain, like messaging queues or configuration parameters.</p>

<p>Then it comes The Net Planet ( a firm represented by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/flavio-percoco-premoli/b/61/457">Flavio Percoco</a> and Alberto Paro ), which introduces MongoDB to the crowd, coupled with <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>, a system built to solve research issues.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t enjoyed it so much because they didn&#8217;t dig into Mongo but mainly explained the common infrastructure they use on their products/systems.</p>

<h2>Technologic contextualization</h2>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/antirez">Antirez</a>, creator of <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>, had an amazing talk about his product and the NoSQL panorama: he was really capable to enjoy the crowd and contextualize NoSQL solutions&#8217; use cases.</p>

<p>I really appreciated that he specified the limitations of Redis and other non-relational databases: as far as Redis is concerned, he told us that the cases where it fits really well are <strong>caching</strong>, <strong>messaging queues</strong> and <strong>fast computations</strong> ( like intersections between datasets ).</p>

<p>We also had the opportunity to talk with him at lunch: a very cool personality :)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/nosqlday-antirez.jpg"></p>

<p>Just after lunch, Gabriele Lana had his 2nd talk, soooo technical, about his 2-years long experience with MongoDB, explaining to the attendees a few tricks and howtos when dealing with this product.</p>

<p>It was a pity that we were in heavy digestion&#8230; ;-)</p>

<h2>OrientDB</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/nosqlday-garulli.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="http://zion-city.blogspot.com/">Luca Garulli</a> introduced to the conference <a href="http://www.orientechnologies.com/">OrientDB</a>, a <strong>fast and scalable graphdb</strong> for the masses, written in Java with 2 interfaces, binary and HTTP.</p>

<p>Although I knew Orient ( and I will <a href="https://github.com/odino/Orient">know it better</a> ), it was great to listen the creator of this cool product explaining all the features that would probably solve a lot of the problems I mentioned at the beginning of this post.</p>

<h2>What did the NoSQL day gave us?</h2>

<p>The consciousness about this technology: buzzwords are often abused, and time after time every technology is marked as <strong>definitive</strong>, because the <strong>one size fits all rule</strong> hasn&#8217;t penetrated in software engineering yet.</p>

<p>So this kind of events are the glue between a technology and its proper usage, because they introduce you to a new world as well as they boost your productivity.</p>

<h2>Next big thing</h2>

<p>We will have our first <strong>Node.js conference in Italy</strong> in september and I can&#8217;t wait for it: so&#8230; Thanks and kudos to <a href="http://www.webdebs.org/">WebDeBs</a>, the organizers of the &#8220;for real&#8221; conferences!</p>
