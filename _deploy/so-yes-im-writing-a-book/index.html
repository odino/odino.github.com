<div class="entry-content"><p>As announced on twitter a few days back, it seems
that the time has come for me to step up and start
dealing with printed paper.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve never talked about,
and especially in the last 9 months I wanted
to start something towards this direction &ndash;
my draft of
<a href="https://leanpub.com/rest-webservices-php">REST webservices in PHP</a>
is still there ideed.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/garulli-nadalin.jpeg"></p>

<p>At the same time, even though self-publishing
is easier and provides good motivation at first,
<strong>is not very attractive on the long run</strong>,
for both the author and the reader: yes, you
get to reach a wide audience, yes, they can
learn in a really cheap way<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
but writing a <strong>real</strong> book is way different.
It&rsquo;s a statement, a printed statement: it is
<strong>just different</strong>.</p>

<p>The chance has come quite quickly, as I will be
<strong>co-author</strong> of a book by
<a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Publications Co.</a>,
which is a very important editor when it comes to
the language with the J.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange? I am a seasoned lead developer
on the LAMP stack but I will write a book dealing with a tool
that has something to do with Java: there a reason,
of course, behind this.</p>

<p>And probably you have already guessed it.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='OrientDB is not just a NoSQL graphDB, it is a brand new way to think about storage engines'>
Long story short, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/garulli">Luca Garulli</a><sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>,
the brilliant mind who gave
OrientDB, a sensational document-graph database, to the world, needed
some more fat fingers helping him for the first ever
book on the topic, and being directly connected to Luca
&ndash; as he used to work with my previous CTO,
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlombardi">Alex</a>, we
both attended the 2011 NoSQL Day and we&rsquo;ve spent
some time together when I was living in Rome &ndash;
made us decide to try to make it together: I feel we
are a perfect match, given my <em>youngsta</em> passion and his
endless commitment to his baby.</p>

<p>Fact is that OrientDB is not just a NoSQL graphDB, it is a brand new way to think about storage engines in 2012 , when we already proved that relational databases won&rsquo;t fit all the scenarios out there,
that <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">document DBs over HTTP</a>
aren&rsquo;t a long-term solution and that we live in a world
where <strong>linked data is a first class citizen in our lives</strong>,
not just somewhere in the internets.
</span></p>

<p>Our challenge is to evangelize this new frontier for
data storage: I&rsquo;m sure it will be a long but succesfull
way.</p>
