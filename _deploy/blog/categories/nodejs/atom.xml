    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I migrated all the possible issues I knew
from <a href="https://github.com/odino/nikki">nikki</a>&rsquo;s
README to <a href="https://github.com/odino/nikki/issues">github&rsquo;s issues</a>, and started
addressing the first few of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are new to nikki, you might want to read
<a href="/last-weekend-i-wrote-an-ide-in-javascript/">this introductory post</a> I wrote a while ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the things I&rsquo;ve been hacking on today:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you tried to open a non-existing directory the server
would crash, now it&rsquo;s simply telling you you&rsquo;re trying to do
something nasty</li>
<li>I added <a href="https://github.com/odino/nikki/blob/master/client/images/favicon.png">this awesome favicon</a> :)</li>
<li>I ported the keyboard shortcuts to the Mac:
whatever you were able to do with <code>ctrl</code> now is also available
with <code>âŒ˜</code></li>
<li>when you boot nikki, now, you will be able to see it running
under the name <code>nikki</code> in the process' list (try a <code>ps -ef | grep nikki</code>)</li>
<li>you can customize the <a href="https://github.com/odino/nikki/blob/master/.nikki.yml#L9-L25">mappings for syntax highlighting</a> by adding
them in your <code>.nikki.yml</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Contextually, I released <code>v0.16.5</code>, so simply run an
<code>npm update -g nikki</code> and enjoy this bunch of new things!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past days I&rsquo;ve been spending some hours on a project
I had in mind since a while, and finally got to roll out
something I am already using on a daily basis: a fast IDE
that runs within a browser.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Nikki</h2>

<p>The idea is very simple: why booting a Java monster like
WebStorm / Eclipse / Netbeans when you can satisfy all
of your basic needs with a simple <code>&lt;div contenteditable /&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>Well, because a browser editor would still need to be able
to talk with your filesystem, and that&rsquo;s something a completely
&ldquo;frontend&rdquo; JS app wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do
(<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/webide-lands-in-nightly/">but might be able to do soon</a>).</p>

<p>So, take JavaScript, put it on the frontend (browser), put
it on the backend (NodeJS), get them to talk (socket.io) and
use a pretty good web editor (ACE), add <code>ctrl + f</code> and <code>ctrl + s</code>
and we&rsquo;re done:</p>

<h2>How to get started</h2>

<p>Simply install nikki with an <code>npm install -g nikki</code>, <code>cd</code>
into a project&rsquo;s directory and launch the editor with the <code>nikki</code>
command: the editor will launch a new browser window to let
you have fun with your project.</p>

<p>A <code>nikki --help</code> might get the confusion away, but if you
really want to give the project a closer look simply check
the <a href="https://github.com/odino/nikki">README on github</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, of course, of course, I need to clarify a few points:
first of all, nikki is not a &ldquo;real&rdquo; IDE, it&rsquo;s  more a text editor
(the marketer in me!), and it didn&rsquo;t really come out in a single weekend
(even though  the basics were setup last WE); last but not least,
I&rsquo;m not a javascripter (<a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/odino/">I guess</a>), so most of the credit goes
to <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a>, the <a href="http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about">ACE editor</a>
and <a href="https://it.linkedin.com/in/davidfunaro">David</a>, who made me write my
very first lines of JS back in 2011 (I know, so late!)</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing this thing 2 weeks ago and I&rsquo;m very happy
with where I&rsquo;ve got so far; in fact, I am writing
this post from &ldquo;my&rdquo; nikki, here&rsquo;s the proof:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nikki-proof.png"></p>

<p>I plan on fixing a few more bugs I have in my todo list
(because they&rsquo;re &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; me) and would be extremely happy
to fix anything you find while playing with nikki: I must admit
that, by using the latest version of Chrome on Linux, I might
have broken a few things on other browsers, so I&rsquo;d be very
happy to fix anything that comes up (ofc don&rsquo;t mention IE).</p>

<h2>One more thing</h2>

<p>As per the README:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, couldn&rsquo;t you simply use TextMate or LightTable?</p>

<p>Yes, but then, where&rsquo;s the fun?</p></blockquote>

<p>Remember, this is a pet project and I firstly did it for
fun, learning and to practice a bit over my spare time:
it is nothing groundbreaking or rocket-science, and I
don&rsquo;t see this going anywhere but my laptop (in terms of
userbase). If you wish to use (or at least try) nikki
I would be very happy though :)</p>
