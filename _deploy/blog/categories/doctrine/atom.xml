    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A post in the <em>doctrine-dev</em> mailing list
caught my attention last week, and I want to
share its insights with you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The good <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius">Marco Pivetta</a>
took initiative in adding proxy generation for hydrators,
and in <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/pull/29">a lonely branch</a>
he&rsquo;s pretty far with the progress on the matter: his
latest tests show that the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/Ocramius/ProxyManager/jobs/6485136#L127">hydration process is improved by 80%</a>
which is a very good news, considered metadata-based
software usually need to find a way to drastically
improve performances because of the basic lack of
performances due to having to read metadata.</p>

<p>Hoping to see this changes integrated in a stable
branch very soon!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, after heavily testing performances
on a project, I pushed some small but
precious changes to the
<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm">orientdb-odm</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil</p><footer><strong>Donald Knuth <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization</a> C2 wiki</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In these days I was testing performances of a
service I am building with
<a href="https://github.com/nuvolabase/orientdb">OrientDB</a>
and the doctrine ODM that
<a href="/please-welcome-the-doctrine-orientdb-odm/">we built so far</a>.</p>

<p>Following one of the golden rules for software
architects, we didn&rsquo;t paid attention to performances &ndash; at first &ndash;
but rather went for a design which would allow us
to inject behaviours and easily change portions of code
(also thanks to the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/doctrine/orientdb-odm">test suite</a>),
I knew that I would have noticed huge flaws at
performance level when testing it with
<strong>production data</strong>.</p>

<p>A few days ago we committed fetchplans for repository
classes, but it wasnt enough: rather then concentrating
on which data we should fetch, I realized one major
improvement could be applied on how we <strong>map</strong> data.</p>

<h2>The golden rule</h2>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<h2>How we did it</h2>

<p>With a <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm/commit/df875c946e02a9c84eee22f0c86e0a3b06bd70ec">single commit</a>
&ndash; there&rsquo;s always room for improvements &ndash; the ODM is now able
to hydrate objects <strong>5 times faster</strong>: when you hydrate similar
objects from OrientDB (for example, 2 records that share the same
attributes' values, like <code>is_published</code> or <code>country</code>), there is
no need to duplicate operations, so we added a <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm/blob/df875c946e02a9c84eee22f0c86e0a3b06bd70ec/src/Doctrine/OrientDB/Util/Inflector/Cached.php">cached inflector</a>
(with an in-memory / single request cache) and did some other
improvements to the <code>Mapper</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>cached the relations between <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm/commit/df875c946e02a9c84eee22f0c86e0a3b06bd70ec#L0L297">PHP classes and OrientDB classes</a> (if 2 records of the same OrientDB class are hydrated, there is only one single <em>search</em> operation to find the PHP class that should map them)</li>
<li>cached the <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm/commit/df875c946e02a9c84eee22f0c86e0a3b06bd70ec#L0L223">casting of properties</a> (if 2 objects have the same value for the <code>is_published</code> attribute, casting is done once)</li>
<li>cached <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm/commit/df875c946e02a9c84eee22f0c86e0a3b06bd70ec#L0L466">properties' annotations</a> (property-level annotations are inspected once per class)</li>
</ul>


<p>There is no rocket science in what we did, but benchmarks ensure that
it&rsquo;s a <strong>huge performance improvement</strong>.</p>

<h2>By the way, we used Webgrind</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/webgrind.png"></p>

<p>Doing almost all of my work from a Mac, I kind of
missed <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">KCacheGrind</a>
for profiling, so I was looking for an
alternative (no, installing
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/xhprof">XHPROF</a> isn&rsquo;t an alternative at 2 in the morning)
and I found Webgrind (which is cross-platform), a web profiler
that requires zero setup:
you basically just need to provide it access from the webserver
and, by opening it with a browser, the application automatically
launches and parses the cachegrind files generated by XDebug.</p>

<p>Webgrind&rsquo;s code is a bit of a mess, but then, the
result is still pretty good &ndash; you get a good overview
of the expensiveness of your calls as well as a
call graph compiled in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language">DOT</a>,
which is a de-facto standard for graph generation.</p>

<h2>New daddy</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve blogged <a href="/blog/categories/orientdb/">so many times</a>
about an imminent
integration into the Doctrine ecosystem, but
due to the workload of our contributors and
some major issues we wanted to solve before this,
we were only able to seriously approach the
Doctrine team today.</p>

<p>This is a very good news, as we will be able
to take advantage of the experience of all the
doctrine contributors as well as have a bigger stage
where we can show the ODM: the biggest part of the
ODM is still pending (persistence), but
HTTP binding, query builder and object
hydration are working like a charm, and the few
bugs that we face in <a href="https://github.com/odino/sharah">real-world scenarios</a>
are solved in a matter of minutes.</p>

<h2>And now?</h2>

<p>All the namespaces have been changed, so the old
<code>Congow\Orient</code> has been replaced by
<code>Doctrine\ODM\OrientDB</code> and <code>Doctrine\OrientDB</code>:
if you were already using the library, you will need
to work on the migration a bit.</p>

<p>You may also want to have a look at the new
<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/orientdb-odm">Packagist page</a>,
as it contains the references to the new repository.</p>
