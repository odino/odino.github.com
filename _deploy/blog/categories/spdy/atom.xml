    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In these days <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol">SPDY</a> it's gaining
its <em>momentum</em> due to a good article which explained how you should build
your <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2012/01/18/building-a-modern-web-stack-for-the-realtime-web/">technologic stack in the <em>realtime</em> web</a>.</p>

<h2>HTTP is slowly dying</h2>

<p>This seems to be the conclusion that lot of people had after reading that article:
SPDY is a newer, faster, more modern protocol and I have no problem in admitting
that <em>a few</em> parts of the HTTP protocol need to be reviewed<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>: you
can't simply advocate that HTTP fits <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2011Dec/0034.html">perfectly</a>
in today's web, that's a <em>de-facto</em> issue.</p>

<h2>SPDY in a nutshell</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/spdy.packet.png"></p>

<p>SPDY is just a <strong>really good protocol implementation</strong>: it supports multiplexing,
<strong>encourages</strong> content compression, allows servers to <strong>push notifications</strong> and
lets you prioritize requests, just to mention the hottest features among
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">others</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon is currently shipping its Kindle with a browser that uses this protocol
to communicate with EC2 instances, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Features/SPDY">Firefox 11 will support it</a>
while - if using a google product - you may already be using SPDY<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>:
the road is long, but SPDY seems to be WWW's <em>next big thing</em>.</p>

<h2>SPDY needs to love HTTP</h2>

<p>Before going out there yelling at HTTP and telling everyone that SPDY will be
the new, futuristic, what-we-were-missing web protocol I want you to consider a
few things.</p>

<p>It should not surprise you the fact that SPDY is <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft2#TOC-HTTP-Layering-over-SPDY">almost-completely</a>
implementing <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>: <strong>the web relies on
established semantics</strong>, clients and servers interact based on a series of
well-known verbs, feedbacks and metadata associated to resources, that are the
only immanent concept of the web.</p>

<h2>Divide et impera: HTTP's soul is here to stay</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>[We have] 10 years of implementation experience of RFC2616</p><footer><strong>Mark Nottingham</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2012/01/06-minutes#item02'>HTTP Futures and SPDY</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>You should really reconsider the HTTP protocol as 2 separate layers: its
technical implementation and its interface.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The [HTTP] interface is designed to be efficient for large-grain [...] data transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web.</p><footer><strong>Roy T. Fielding</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5'>The Uniform Interface</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The technical implementation may be a little updated<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> but its
interface was thought to be able to let machine and humans interact with
resources in the most open, fault-tolerant, scalable, robust way we could have
ever thought: <strong>without relying on HTTP, SPDY would not work</strong>, not in the ancient,
not in the modern, not even in the future web.</p>

<p>HTTP 2.0 is close, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2012/01/06-minutes#item02">the W3C is not blind</a>.</p>
