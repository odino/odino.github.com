    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than a decade ago the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser war</a>
made his victim: it was Netscape, which
couldn't compete with Microsoft and its
IE: after long time, it's time for this
decadent winner to retreat.</p>

<p>Today I was spending a few minutes on
<a href="http://caniuse.com/">IcanUse</a>, a brilliant service which
gives you informations on features implemented
by modern web browsers: not surprisingly,
IE is a total disappointment.</p>

<p>So I decided to take a look at what the <strong>current</strong> browsers
are implementing, retrieving some nice
charts to compare them against each other:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:31,83,94,75,65|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20JS-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:59,88,97,94,97|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20SVG-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:63,82,89,88,73|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20CSS-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:40,71,94,80,80|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20HTML5-related%20feature"></p>

<p>It's not a surprise that IE9 is the worst browser out there,
but this made me think about how long it will be
a competitor in the market.</p>

<p>IE is slowly dying, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Usage_share_of_web_browsers_%28Source_StatCounter%29.svg">we all know</a>:
just as netscape, it's not able to face competitors
pushing hard to deliver the best
web-browsing experience.</p>

<p>It will take a few months, maybe years, to see
IE leaving the market kicked out by the yougsters,
nontheless it will be a great day for the
internet: the day that who fights for the
innovation will definitely overwhelm who
sits on top of his past, glorious days.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like it or not, pushing the work to the clients is
a tecnique which made the web able to scale the way
it is now: <strong>search engines are making it slower</strong> and
less scalable, as they don't want us to do so.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The problem is that JavaScript - the <em>creepy</em> JavaScript -
is now recognized as a first-level programming language<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
although SE are around since more than a decade: thus,
crawlers and spiders, although able to interpretate basic
JS code, cannot do more complex stuff, like managing
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlerbars</a> or <a href="http://mnot.github.com/hinclude/">HInclude</a>.</p>

<p>Or, at least, we don't know if they can.</p>

<p>There would be a workaround to this kind of issue, by just
<strong>serving different content for JS-aware clients</strong>, so that a
spider could see the whole resource without the need of
executing JS code: a workaround that would cost in terms of
development time, but still an acceptable workaround.</p>

<p>The problem, here, is that tis tecnique, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking">cloacking</a>
is part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#White_hat_versus_black_hat">black hat SEO</a> list, so you basically can't take
advantage of it as malicious web developers would use
cloacking to serve keyword-stuffed contents to bots and
"normal" webpages to humans, and this is something you
really want to avoid, since SERPs' relevance is an
important part of a user's eb experience.</p>

<p>But, at least, we don't know how search engines would react
to the workaround I just explained.</p>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>We should have clarifications from SE vendors, to know whether
they are able or not to let us take advantage of great JS-based
technologies able to make our applications scale better, or - better -
have fully JS-aware spiders and crawlers, able to elaborate
resources like real-world browsers.</p>

<p>It's not about me, it's not about you, it's about the web: a faster,
and <strong>definitely better</strong>, web.</p>
