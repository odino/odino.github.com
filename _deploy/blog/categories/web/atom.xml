    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With a few days of delay I'm here reporting and commenting
the last <strong>revolutions</strong> about the protocol of the web,
its upcoming groundbreaking new version and its state.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few days back <a href="http://www.mnot.net/">Mark Nottingham</a> announced that the
group is <a href="https://twitter.com/mnot/status/253175410383278081">officially working on the new draft of <code>HTTP/2.0</code></a>:
even though rumors about the shape of this new version were
going on since a couple years, this <strong>official</strong>
news brings some fresh hope on the topic.</p>

<p>As the HTTP protocol was always directly influenced
by great minds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy Fielding</a>, just
to mention a couple names) when I first heard about
Mark taking the responsability to publish <code>HTTP/2.0</code> I
was pretty sure something great would have come out of
his mind.</p>

<p>I wasn't wrong.</p>

<p>It's been 13 years since HTTP doesnt see a major change
in its specification (recent changes are the addition of
the <code>PATCH</code> method, for example, but we're talking about
<strong>minor</strong> stuff) and SPDY - a new protocol created by Google -
came out in the recent history of the web with a disruptive
force.</p>

<p>HTTP needed something.</p>

<h2>SPDY</h2>

<p>But before having a look at what <code>HTTP/2.0</code> will look like,
let's mention the good things that SPDY brings on the table:</p>

<ul>
<li>prioritization: it allows to send different requests and
tell the server to prioritize some of them</li>
<li>multiplexing: allows parallel requests and asynchronous
responses, unlike <em>pipelining</em> which is bound to multiple
requests/responses at the same time</li>
<li>server push: servers can now push resources to the client
without them having to ask for</li>
<li>better performances: extended compression is one of the
key FTW of SPDY</li>
</ul>


<p>But there is one things that SPDY doesn't change at all:
the <strong>interface</strong> between the machines.</p>

<p>As recognized worldwide, the HTTP protocol was an almost
perfect example of M2M interface which allows servers
and clients to follow DAPs (<em>domain-application protocols</em>)
according to a loosely coupled interface - the protocol itself,
with its verbs, semantics and workflows<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So SPDY, recognizing the perfection of the contract that HTTP
puts among clients and servers, isn't a real new protocol, it's
a <strong>better implementation of the same interface</strong>.</p>

<h2>HTTP/2.0 is an evolution of an evolution</h2>

<p>No wonder, then, in reading the words of Nottingham, as, after
all, he "just" announced that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2012OctDec/0004.html"><code>HTTP/2.0</code> will be <strong>based on SPDY</strong></a>:
a great news that is basically telling you the "don't reinvent the wheel"
principle is even applied at the foundation of the web<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The layers will definitely be different, but, again, I think
that having a newer version of our beloved protocol, based on a
specification which already improves it and adds tons of new and
interesting features, is going to be <strong>a game-changer for web
applications</strong>.</p>

<p>Will we see <code>HTTP/2.0</code> being deployed with multiplexing, server push,
prioritization and extended compression next year?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than a decade ago the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser war</a>
made his victim: it was Netscape, which
couldn't compete with Microsoft and its
IE: after long time, it's time for this
decadent winner to retreat.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Today I was spending a few minutes on
<a href="http://caniuse.com/">IcanUse</a>, a brilliant service which
gives you informations on features implemented
by modern web browsers: not surprisingly,
IE is a total disappointment.</p>

<p>So I decided to take a look at what the <strong>current</strong> browsers
are implementing, retrieving some nice
charts to compare them against each other:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:31,83,94,75,65|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20JS-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:59,88,97,94,97|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20SVG-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:63,82,89,88,73|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20CSS-related%20feature"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=bvs&amp;chco=4D89F9,C6D9FD&amp;chd=t:40,71,94,80,80|100,100,100,100,100&amp;chxl=0:|IE|Firefox|Chrome|Safari|Opera&amp;chs=750x400&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chbh=120&amp;chtt=Implementation%20of%20HTML5-related%20feature"></p>

<p>It's not a surprise that IE9 is the worst browser out there,
but this made me think about how long it will be
a competitor in the market.</p>

<p>IE is slowly dying, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Usage_share_of_web_browsers_%28Source_StatCounter%29.svg">we all know</a>:
just as netscape, it's not able to face competitors
pushing hard to deliver the best
web-browsing experience.</p>

<p>It will take a few months, maybe years, to see
IE leaving the market kicked out by the yougsters,
nontheless it will be a great day for the
internet: the day that who fights for the
innovation will definitely overwhelm who
sits on top of his past, glorious days.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-07T10:00:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.odino.org/search-engines-are-making-the-web-slower</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like it or not, pushing the work to the clients is
a tecnique which made the web able to scale the way
it is now: <strong>search engines are making it slower</strong> and
less scalable, as they don't want us to do so.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The problem is that JavaScript - the <em>creepy</em> JavaScript -
is now recognized as a first-level programming language<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
although SE are around since more than a decade: thus,
crawlers and spiders, although able to interpretate basic
JS code, cannot do more complex stuff, like managing
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlerbars</a> or <a href="http://mnot.github.com/hinclude/">HInclude</a>.</p>

<p>Or, at least, we don't know if they can.</p>

<p>There would be a workaround to this kind of issue, by just
<strong>serving different content for JS-aware clients</strong>, so that a
spider could see the whole resource without the need of
executing JS code: a workaround that would cost in terms of
development time, but still an acceptable workaround.</p>

<p>The problem, here, is that tis tecnique, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking">cloacking</a>
is part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#White_hat_versus_black_hat">black hat SEO</a> list, so you basically can't take
advantage of it as malicious web developers would use
cloacking to serve keyword-stuffed contents to bots and
"normal" webpages to humans, and this is something you
really want to avoid, since SERPs' relevance is an
important part of a user's eb experience.</p>

<p>But, at least, we don't know how search engines would react
to the workaround I just explained.</p>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>We should have clarifications from SE vendors, to know whether
they are able or not to let us take advantage of great JS-based
technologies able to make our applications scale better, or - better -
have fully JS-aware spiders and crawlers, able to elaborate
resources like real-world browsers.</p>

<p>It's not about me, it's not about you, it's about the web: a faster,
and <strong>definitely better</strong>, web.</p>
