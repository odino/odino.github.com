I gave my second (and last) talk at the <a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a>
in San Francisco.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a slightly remixed version of the same talk I gave at the
IPC in Germany last year, with a few addition and changes: I hope the
attendees have enjoyed the conference as well as my 2 <strong>small</strong>
contributions as much as I did.</p>

<p>As usual, the presentation is on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-end-of-the-road-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">slideshare</a>:
here are the slides for the lazy ones :)</p>

be travelling to reach SF and
the <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest</a>, the annual
conference about
<a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Funny thing is, I have two talks
and none of them deals with Cake, <strong>at all</strong> :)</p>

<p>I will be talking about the
evolution of Web Protocols, in
particular HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, in a
remake of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">talk I gave the IPC</a>,
in Mainz, last year.</p>

<p>My second talk will be a <em>new entry</em>, a
collection of tips, advices and tricks
in order to manage a SOA, learnt <strong>the hard
way</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are going to be around San Francisco
in the first days of Semptember, feel free to

    <link href="http://odino.org/securing-your-http-api-with-javascript-object-signing-and-encryption/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-04T00:31:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://odino.org/securing-your-http-api-with-javascript-object-signing-and-encryption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing that is always difficult, enough to
deserve <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Security-Billy-Hoffman/dp/0321491939">its own book</a>,
is to <strong>secure HTTP API</strong> that interact with client-side
applications: today, after a discussion about how to face
the problem in our company, we bumped into the
<a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature/?include_text=1">JOSE</a>
&ndash; JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption &ndash;
specification.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically, the specification defines 4 entities:</p>

<ul>
<li>JWS, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-signature-04">JSON Web Signature</a>,
a signed representation of data</li>
<li>JWT, <a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html">JSON Web Token</a>,
a representation of data
(it differs from JWS as JWT is not signed)</li>
<li>JWE, <a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption.html">JSON Web Encryption</a>,
an encrypted JSON representation of data</li>
<li>JWA, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-00">JSON Web Algorithms</a>,
a list of safe algorithms to be used with JWS and JWE</li>
</ul>


<p>For the sake of basic knowledge, we will only have a look
at JWS and JWT / JWE now: the specifications about these
entities are quite extensive and not very straightforward,
so for further details you should <strong>really</strong> give them
a look.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/jws.png"></p>

<h2>JWT</h2>

<p>Basically, the token (JWT) is the simplest structure
that you will deal with while implementing JOSE in our
architecture; it is a string representation of some data
base64 encoded (other types of encoding might be applied, but
this is not madatory): the JWT differs from raw base64-encoded
data since it also includes informations about the encoding
itself, in the token&rsquo;s header; by concatenating the base64-encoded
version of the token header and payload (the actual data) you
obtain what the specification calls <strong>signature input</strong>, which will
then be used to create the signature (JWS).</p>

<h2>JWS and JWE</h2>

<p>After the JWT comes the JWS, which is a signed representation
of the JWT; it differs from the token just because of the
signature; on an higher step of the ladder comes the JWE instead,
which lets you encrypt the data in order to achieve an higher security
level: the <a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption.html#JWEExamples">examples in the ietf draft</a>
show you how to create JWEs with a pair of private /
public keys.</p>

<h2>Use case: how to authenticate stateless AJAX calls?</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/jsw-auth.png"></p>

<p>One of the needs that you might have is to,
from JavaScript, make authenticated HTTP calls to
one of your webservices: since you don&rsquo;t want to
expose the WS credentials on the JS service (the
credentials would be readable by any client) a good
solution might be to generate a JWS with a private
OpenSSL key in your webservice, store it into a cookie
accessible to the JS service, which would execute
those calls including that cookie<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>, which you can then
verify while authenticating the call.</p>

<p>This workflow is pretty easy to understand, but the actual
implementation is more than tricky, since the
specification is quite abundant &ndash; especially about
encryption algorithms.</p>

<p>In PHP we can use at least 3 libraries: one of them,
<a href="https://github.com/ritou/php-Akita_JOSE">Akita_JOSE</a>,
is pretty old (since the last commit was more than
7 months ago) but is very understandable and quite
easy to use; another one, <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/gree/jose">gree/jose</a>,
has itw own package on packagist and can be easily
installed via composer: from a fast look at the
<a href="https://github.com/gree/jose">source code on GitHub</a> it looks good,
even though it needs the <a href="http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/">phpsec</a>
library to be able to work<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The third option, which is the one that <a href="https://github.com/namshi/jose">I built in the last couple of hours</a>,
is <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/namshi/jose">namshi/jose</a>,
which is very, very easy to use<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>: it currently only
supports the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/jose/blob/master/src/Namshi/JOSE/Signer/RS256.php">RSA algorithm</a>
with <code>sha256</code> hashing, but I guess that implementing other
algorithms is less than trivial.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s see how you would generate the JWS
to be stored in a cookie:</p>

<p>``` php Generating a JWS after authentication and storing it into a cookie
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Namshi\JOSE\JWS;</p>

<p>if ($username == &lsquo;correctUsername&rsquo; &amp;&amp; $pass = &lsquo;ok&rsquo;) {</p>

<pre><code>$user = Db::loadUserByUsername($username);

$jws  = new JWS('RS256');
$jws-&gt;setPayload(array(
    'uid' =&gt; $user-&gt;getid(),
));

$privateKey = openssl_pkey_get_private("file://path/to/private.key");
$jws-&gt;sign($privateKey);
setcookie('identity', $jws-&gt;getTokenString());
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>and then the apps that want to execute authenticated
calls on behalf of the user by using this cookie just need
to include it in these calls; the server will just need
to verify that the JWS in the cookie is valid:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Namshi\JOSE\JWS;</p>

<p>$jws        = JWS::load($_COOKIE[&lsquo;identity&rsquo;]);
$public_key = openssl_pkey_get_public(&ldquo;/path/to/public.key&rdquo;);</p>

<p>if ($jws->verify($public_key)) {</p>

<pre><code>$paylod = $jws-&gt;getPayload();

echo sprintf("Hey, my JS app just did an action authenticated as user #%s", $payload['id']);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it: far from being a stable library, this is more a
proof of concept that we, an Namshi, would like to see developing
in the next weeks / months.</p>

<p>As always, comments, rants or &ndash; even better &ndash; pull requests are
<strong>more than welcome</strong>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With a few days of delay I&rsquo;m here reporting and commenting
the last <strong>revolutions</strong> about the protocol of the web,
its upcoming groundbreaking new version and its state.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few days back <a href="http://www.mnot.net/">Mark Nottingham</a> announced that the
group is <a href="https://twitter.com/mnot/status/253175410383278081">officially working on the new draft of <code>HTTP/2.0</code></a>:
even though rumors about the shape of this new version were
going on since a couple years, this <strong>official</strong>
news brings some fresh hope on the topic.</p>

<p>As the HTTP protocol was always directly influenced
by great minds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy Fielding</a>, just
to mention a couple names) when I first heard about
Mark taking the responsability to publish <code>HTTP/2.0</code> I
was pretty sure something great would have come out of
his mind.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 13 years since HTTP doesnt see a major change
in its specification (recent changes are the addition of
the <code>PATCH</code> method, for example, but we&rsquo;re talking about
<strong>minor</strong> stuff) and SPDY &ndash; a new protocol created by Google &ndash;
came out in the recent history of the web with a disruptive
force.</p>

<p>HTTP needed something.</p>

<h2>SPDY</h2>

<p>But before having a look at what <code>HTTP/2.0</code> will look like,
let&rsquo;s mention the good things that SPDY brings on the table:</p>

<ul>
<li>prioritization: it allows to send different requests and
tell the server to prioritize some of them</li>
<li>multiplexing: allows parallel requests and asynchronous
responses, unlike <em>pipelining</em> which is bound to multiple
requests/responses at the same time</li>
<li>server push: servers can now push resources to the client
without them having to ask for</li>
<li>better performances: extended compression is one of the
key FTW of SPDY</li>
</ul>


<p>But there is one things that SPDY doesn&rsquo;t change at all:
the <strong>interface</strong> between the machines.</p>

<p>As recognized worldwide, the HTTP protocol was an almost
perfect example of M2M interface which allows servers
and clients to follow DAPs (<em>domain-application protocols</em>)
according to a loosely coupled interface &ndash; the protocol itself,
with its verbs, semantics and workflows<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So SPDY, recognizing the perfection of the contract that HTTP
puts among clients and servers, isn&rsquo;t a real new protocol, it&rsquo;s
a <strong>better implementation of the same interface</strong>.</p>

<h2>HTTP/2.0 is an evolution of an evolution</h2>

<p>No wonder, then, in reading the words of Nottingham, as, after
all, he &ldquo;just&rdquo; announced that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2012OctDec/0004.html"><code>HTTP/2.0</code> will be <strong>based on SPDY</strong></a>:
a great news that is basically telling you the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel&rdquo;
principle is even applied at the foundation of the web<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The layers will definitely be different, but, again, I think
that having a newer version of our beloved protocol, based on a
specification which already improves it and adds tons of new and
interesting features, is going to be <strong>a game-changer for web
applications</strong>.</p>

<p>Will we see <code>HTTP/2.0</code> being deployed with multiplexing, server push,
prioritization and extended compression next year?</p>
