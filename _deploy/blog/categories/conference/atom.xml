    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, tired like hell due to an almost sleepless night,
I gave my second (and last) talk at the <a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a>
in San Francisco.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a slightly remixed version of the same talk I gave at the
IPC in Germany last year, with a few addition and changes: I hope the
attendees have enjoyed the conference as well as my 2 <strong>small</strong>
contributions as much as I did.</p>

<p>As usual, the presentation is on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-end-of-the-road-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">slideshare</a>:
here are the slides for the lazy ones :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I gave the first of my 2 presentations scheduled for the
<a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> here in San Francisco,
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">Tips and Tricks for your SOA</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It basically contains a few tips derived from our experience at
<a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a> while building our own service-oriented
architecture, and I hope, since there&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> much material
about SOA out there, that this can serve as a good feedback from who
is actually embracing this architectural style.</p>

<p>As always, the slides are on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">slideshare</a>,
and I&rsquo;m embedding the presentation
here for those who immediately want to have a look at it:</p>

<p><div class="slideshare" id="__ss_25786089"><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/25786089 " width="850" height="730" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p>

<p>Tomorrow, as per the conference&rsquo;s schedule, I will be giving my other talk,
&ldquo;HTTP colon slash slash: end of the road?&rdquo;, a remake of what I
presented at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">IPC in Mainz last year</a>,
with some more contents and &ndash; hopefully &ndash; fancier slides :-P</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of August I will
be travelling to reach SF and
the <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest</a>, the annual
conference about
<a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Funny thing is, I have two talks
and none of them deals with Cake, <strong>at all</strong> :)</p>

<p>I will be talking about the
evolution of Web Protocols, in
particular HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, in a
remake of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">talk I gave the IPC</a>,
in Mainz, last year.</p>

<p>My second talk will be a <em>new entry</em>, a
collection of tips, advices and tricks
in order to manage a SOA, learnt <strong>the hard
way</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are going to be around San Francisco
in the first days of Semptember, feel free to
ping me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had the opportunity to share with the
people at the <a href="http://www.phptostart.it/">PHP.TO.START</a>
in Turin my 1-year experience in Namshi, one of
Rocket Internet&rsquo;s ventures in the Middle East.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="/images/phptostart2013.jpg"></p>

<p>Luckily, this was a great opportunity to meet some good
old friends and the talk went very well: of course,
the reharsal at the <a href="http://roma.grusp.org">PHP User Group in Rome</a>
earlier this week was a bless.</p>

<p>It basically deals with the phases that I experienced
with our team in Namshi, with some spicy details on
recruiting (from looking for talents to conducting
interviews), how to <strong>change processes to help people improving</strong>
(and not change people to improve processes) and
a big picture on what we were able to plan and achieve
in this year together, from a technical point of view.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk I invited everyone interested, and
I will repeat myself here, to look for the open positions
on <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com/careers/">our careers site</a>,
since we are currently hiring a Lead Developer and a
PHP Developer (a junior or an intermediate, it&rsquo;s more
about the approach rather than the hands-on experience).</p>

<p>Here are the slides of the talk, in a slightly better (and more colored)
version compared to the ones I used in Rome:</p>

    <updated>2013-03-29T14:14:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://odino.org/a-brief-visit-to-the-cold-lands-of-italy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying a relatively long &ndash; at least for me &ndash; 2 weeks &ldquo;vacation&rdquo;
back in Italy, since I was missing my friends in Rome
since <strong>exactly</strong> a year and the last time my parents saw me it
was 6 months ago.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Fun thing is, since I can&rsquo;t miss the opportunity
of getting back in touch with a few people, I will
be joining 4 tech events:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rome.codemotionworld.com/">Codemotion</a> &ndash; already happened, I was there on the 23rd &ndash; the conference open to
all the programming languages, in Rome</li>
<li><a href="http://roma.grusp.org/">PHP User group Rome</a>, a meetup that is held monthly, for one of
the user groups that I helped launching here in Italy, again in Rome, where I gave
a talk about assembling a mid-sized PHP team</li>
<li><a href="http://www.phptostart.it/">PHP.TO.START</a> &ndash; happening <strong>right now </strong>&ndash; a yearly event for the
north-western italian PHP community, where I&rsquo;ll be presenting the same talk I had at
the PUG Rome</li>
<li><a href="http://friuli.grusp.org/">PHP User Group Friuli</a>, another meetup organized by one of the
italian PHP User Groups, where I&rsquo;ll be presenting an <em>unknown</em> topic (at least for now)</li>
</ul>


<p>An <strong>important thing</strong>: I am actively recruiting for our company,
<a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com/careers/technology/">Namshi</a>, so if you
are interested in one of the open positions that we have right now
(in particular, Lead Developer and PHP Developer), feel free to approach
me if you find me at the upcoming events (in Turin and Udine).</p>
