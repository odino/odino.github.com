    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late november I will be for a few days in Paris,
attending and speaking at the 2013 edition of the
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php">Forum PHP Paris</a>:
funny enough, I&rsquo;ve only been to Paris for conferences so far,
as my <em>first-timer</em> there was during the
<a href="/symfony-live-2011-my-pov/">2011 edition of the Symfony Live</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/paris.jpg"></p>

<p>Topic of my talk will be what we&rsquo;ve witnessed
at <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#894">Namshi building our team and stack</a>:
from recruiting talents to automated testing, from
SOA&rsquo;s rules to deciding to use cutting-edge technologies
like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>: don&rsquo;t miss the
opportunity to
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/inscription.php">reserve your seat for the event</a>,
since there will be amazing speakers, like
Igor Wiedler talking about <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#967">Stack</a>,
PHP&rsquo;s rack, and
Dustin Whittle who will give his insights about
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#964">scaling PHP apps</a>.</p>

<p>See you in the core of europe!</p>

I gave my second (and last) talk at the <a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a>
in San Francisco.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a slightly remixed version of the same talk I gave at the
IPC in Germany last year, with a few addition and changes: I hope the
attendees have enjoyed the conference as well as my 2 <strong>small</strong>
contributions as much as I did.</p>

<p>As usual, the presentation is on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-end-of-the-road-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">slideshare</a>:
here are the slides for the lazy ones :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I gave the first of my 2 presentations scheduled for the
<a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> here in San Francisco,
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">Tips and Tricks for your SOA</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It basically contains a few tips derived from our experience at
<a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a> while building our own service-oriented
architecture, and I hope, since there&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> much material
about SOA out there, that this can serve as a good feedback from who
is actually embracing this architectural style.</p>

<p>As always, the slides are on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/tips-and-tricks-for-your-service-oriented-architecture-cakefest-2013-in-san-francisco">slideshare</a>,
and I&rsquo;m embedding the presentation
here for those who immediately want to have a look at it:</p>

<p><div class="slideshare" id="__ss_25786089"><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/25786089 " width="850" height="730" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p>

<p>Tomorrow, as per the conference&rsquo;s schedule, I will be giving my other talk,
&ldquo;HTTP colon slash slash: end of the road?&rdquo;, a remake of what I
presented at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">IPC in Mainz last year</a>,
with some more contents and &ndash; hopefully &ndash; fancier slides :-P</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of August I will
be travelling to reach SF and
the <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest</a>, the annual
conference about
<a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Funny thing is, I have two talks
and none of them deals with Cake, <strong>at all</strong> :)</p>

<p>I will be talking about the
evolution of Web Protocols, in
particular HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, in a
remake of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">talk I gave the IPC</a>,
in Mainz, last year.</p>

<p>My second talk will be a <em>new entry</em>, a
collection of tips, advices and tricks
in order to manage a SOA, learnt <strong>the hard
way</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are going to be around San Francisco
in the first days of Semptember, feel free to
ping me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had the opportunity to share with the
people at the <a href="http://www.phptostart.it/">PHP.TO.START</a>
in Turin my 1-year experience in Namshi, one of
Rocket Internet&rsquo;s ventures in the Middle East.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left" src="/images/phptostart2013.jpg"></p>

<p>Luckily, this was a great opportunity to meet some good
old friends and the talk went very well: of course,
the reharsal at the <a href="http://roma.grusp.org">PHP User Group in Rome</a>
earlier this week was a bless.</p>

<p>It basically deals with the phases that I experienced
with our team in Namshi, with some spicy details on
recruiting (from looking for talents to conducting
interviews), how to <strong>change processes to help people improving</strong>
(and not change people to improve processes) and
a big picture on what we were able to plan and achieve
in this year together, from a technical point of view.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk I invited everyone interested, and
I will repeat myself here, to look for the open positions
on <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com/careers/">our careers site</a>,
since we are currently hiring a Lead Developer and a
PHP Developer (a junior or an intermediate, it&rsquo;s more
about the approach rather than the hands-on experience).</p>

<p>Here are the slides of the talk, in a slightly better (and more colored)
version compared to the ones I used in Rome:</p>
