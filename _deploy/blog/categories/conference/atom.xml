    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, from Doha's international airport, I
got the chance to blog about the latest changes
surrounding the upcoming major version of the
protocol of the web, <code>HTTP/2.0</code>.</p>

<p>Today I gave, at the International PHPConference in
Mainz, an overview about HTTP (<code>0.9</code>, <code>1.0</code>, <code>1.1</code>), SPDY
and <code>HTTP/2.0</code> itself.</p>

<p>There's not that much to say, as the presentation is already
on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">Slideshare</a> and I'm embedding it here, other than a thing
the guys here in Germany already heard a lot: <strong>go back to
the basics</strong>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 24 hourse I'll be on a plane which is gonna bring
me in Frankfurt, to then join the <a href="http://phpconference.com/">International PHP Conference</a>
in Mainz.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/ipc-slide.png"></p>

<p>I'm pretty excited since this will be my first visit
to the old continent since I moved to Dubai - almost 7 months ago -
and I'm glad I'll do that for IPC, with a brief <em>pit-stop</em> in Italy -
unfortunately not in Rome.</p>

<p>At IPC I will talk about REST, with an - I hope -
interesting introduction about this architectural style, anti-patterns
and a few tips on how to implement REST's constraints in our
architectures.</p>

<p>I will also have another chance to talk, and I'm <strong>seriously</strong>
excited about it, since, for the first time, I get the chance to
talk about the foundation of our lives in the modern era (<em>homo internectus</em>),
the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>: I will talk a little bit about why we needed it,
with some historical notion about the web's foundation, what SPDY
brings on the table and the recent <strong>revolutions</strong> around <code>HTTP/2.0</code>.</p>

<p>On the 17th evening I will catch a flight for Venice (via Wien) and then
I'll spend some time with the rest of the family, good thing if you also
consider that for the first time in 4 years they're gonna see me for my birthday.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/ale_idiot.jpeg"></p>

<p>But Italy doesn't mean that I'm going to relax <strong>at all</strong>, as I will
finally meet all the guys from the <a href="http://friuli.grusp.org/">PHP User Group Friuli</a>,
the 2nd PHP user group in Italy (considering numbers and history), that
I personally founded along with <a href="http://www.mvassociati.it/it/il-team">Steve&amp;Stefano</a> and <a href="http://it.linkedin.com/in/dlondero">Daniel</a> in front of a pizza,
but never got to join during their
monthly meetings, as I was already based in Rome at that time.</p>

<p>There is no plan about that meeting, as the topic will be "<em>Alessandro Nadalin in tour</em>":
if you are a developer, a technology enthusiast or simply a student come
and join us in Codroipo, as I will also talk about abroad work experiences as well
as scout and recruit for some companies (yes, not only <strong>my</strong> company).</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>No doubts anymore: I will be present - for my first time -
at the most prestigious<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> european PHP conference,
a travel more than 6 thousand kilometers long:</p>

<iframe width="750" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FWObgQEd3exLAylFxtlqSUNfPjFiUSmEUG7mvQ%3BFZ7U-gId1dd9ACl5E98zLpG9RzGgG9sQ1dQiBA&amp;q=from+Dubai+to+Mainz&amp;aq=&amp;sll=32.93158,33.8919&amp;sspn=21.939821,46.538086&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;saddr=Dubai&amp;daddr=Mainz&amp;ll=37.0008,31.761065&amp;spn=26.13436,47.12413&amp;output=embed"></iframe>


<p>I will bring with me a new talk<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>, which
mainly deals with protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>history of <code>HTTP</code></li>
<li>hiddent features of <code>HTTP/1.1</code></li>
<li>what should we expect from <code>HTTP/2.0</code></li>
<li>how <code>SPDY</code> is revolutionizing web protocols</li>
</ul>


<p>If you'll be there, dont hesitate and drop me a line
at <em>alessandro.nadalin@gmail.com</em>, it will be a good
opportunity to have a chat about PHP and the
<a href="/moving-to-dubai/">Middle East</a>.</p>

<p>Subject? Oh, something that I <em>really</em> love:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>For years we've been used to the HTTP protocol, one of the reasons behind the web's success, a protocol able to scale up to bilion of requests and beyond.<br/>But there's more we can achieve, leveraging HTTP/1.1 hidden feature, taking a look at HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, the Google-proposed new protocol which is already making web faster.</p></p><p><p>Back to the basics: what enpowers and will enpower the web?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Still to be confirmed - flights, leave days, date - but I should be able
to make it for the first time among the germans.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
