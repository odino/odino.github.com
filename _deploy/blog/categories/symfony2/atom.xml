    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While implementing various pieces of our
<a href="/why-we-choose-symfony2-over-any-other-php-framework/">Service-Oriented Architecture</a>
we, at <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a>,
realized that a central notification
service would have been very good in order
to abstract the way we notify our customers
and everyone in the company (ie. skype messages
when a task is due a certain date).</p>

<p>We initially implemented all of this
<a href="/configuring-a-symfony2-application-to-support-soa/">inside a Symfony2 bundle</a>,
but soon realized that we could
abstract and generalize our implementation
in order to extract it into a library for the public
domain, and that&rsquo;s how
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator">notificator</a>
was born.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Aim of the library: a monolog-like implementation for notifications</h2>

<p>The aim of this library is to provide a very
clean abstraction for a task, handling notifications,
that can be spread across multiple channels (for example
emails, skype messages, desktop notifications, &hellip;):
by following this target, we soon realized that by merging
together 2 simple things, <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog">Monolog</a>
and the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">event dispatching</a>,
we could have easily reached our goal.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s true that you can achieve the same goal with
Monolog, but the problem, there, is that it&rsquo;s a library
specifically built for logging, thus, when your domain
deals with simple notifications, your code would really
be inexpressive.</p>

<p>Even though <strong>Notificator is way simpler</strong>, we took a lot
of inspiration from Monolog: for example, the concept of
handlers is a total steal ;&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The library is available via composer,
as you can see from its
<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/namshi/notificator">packagist page</a>.</p>

<p>Using semantic versioning, I recommend you
to pick a minor release (<code>1.0</code>, for example)
and stick to it in your <code>composer.json</code>:
what we try to do is that, if there is a BC break
in the API, we increase the minor version (<code>1.0.X</code> to <code>1.1.X</code>, for example).</p>

<p>At the end, you <strong>should</strong> require it like this:</p>

<p><code>
"namshi/notificator": "1.0.*"
</code></p>

<h2>Hello world! example</h2>

<p>Just to give a very rough and simple example on how this
library works, let&rsquo;s see how you can trigger a notification
via <strong>both</strong> email (with PHP&rsquo;s <code>mail</code> function<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>)
and the <code>notify-send</code> utility available on ubuntu (I&rsquo;ve already spoke
about it in <a href="/desktop-notifications-for-phpunit-tests-on-ubuntu/">a previous post</a>).</p>

<p>First of all, we would need to create a <em>plain-old-php-class</em>
representing the notification, which implements 2 interfaces:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Namshi\Notificator\Notification;
use Namshi\Notificator\NotificationInterface;</p>

<p>interface NotifySendNotificationInterface extends NotificationInterface
{</p>

<pre><code>public function getMessage();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>interface EmailNotificationInterface extends NotificationInterface
{</p>

<pre><code>public function getAddress();
public function getSubject();
public function getBody();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>class DoubleNotification extends Notification implements NotifySendNotificationInterface, EmailNotificationInterface
{</p>

<pre><code>protected $address;
protected $body;
protected $subject;

public function __construct($address, $subject, $body, array $parameters = array())
{
    parent::__construct($parameters);

    $this-&gt;address  = $address;
    $this-&gt;body     = $body;
    $this-&gt;subject  = $subject;
}

public function getAddress()
{
    return $this-&gt;address;
}

public function getSubject()
{
    return $this-&gt;subject;
}

public function getBody()
{
    return $this-&gt;body;
}

public function getMessage()
{
    return $this-&gt;getBody();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>At this point we need 2 notification handlers, which
will separately handle the notification:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Namshi\Notificator\Notification\Handler\HandlerInterface;
use Namshi\Notificator\NotificationInterface;</p>

<p>class NotifySendNotificationHandler implements HandlerInterface
{</p>

<pre><code>public function shouldHandle(NotificationInterface $notification)
{
    return $notification instanceOf NotifySendNotificationInterface;
}

public function handle(NotificationInterface $notification)
{
    shell_exec(sprintf('notify-send "%s"', $notification-&gt;getMessage()));
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>class EmailNotificationHandler implements HandlerInterface
{</p>

<pre><code>public function shouldHandle(NotificationInterface $notification)
{
    return $notification instanceOf EmailNotificationInterface;
}

public function handle(NotificationInterface $notification)
{
    mail($notification-&gt;getAddress(), $notification-&gt;getSubject(), $notification-&gt;getBody());
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re basically there: with a bunch of code we can now trigger
a notification both via email and <code>notify-send</code>:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>// create the manager and assign handlers to it
use Namshi\Notificator\Manager;</p>

<p>$manager = new Manager();
$manager->addHandler(new NotifySendNotificationHandler());
$manager->addHandler(new EmailNotificationHandler());</p>

<p>$notification = new DoubleNotification(&lsquo;<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#x6c;&#x65;&#115;&#x73;&#x61;&#x6e;&#100;&#x72;&#111;&#46;&#110;&#97;&#100;&#x61;&#108;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#97;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x73;&#x73;&#97;&#x6e;&#100;&#114;&#111;&#46;&#x6e;&#97;&#100;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;Test email&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo;);</p>

<p>//  trigger the notification
$manager->trigger($notification);
```</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/notification-email.png"></p>

<p>At this point, if you run this example<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>, you should
see a notification popping up on your desktop and, in a few seconds,
you will also receive an email to the address you&rsquo;ve given, with the subject
&ldquo;Test email&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; in the body.</p>

<p>By the way, if you want to see some examples on
how the library works, <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/tree/master/examples">check them out on github</a>.</p>

<h2>Sending notifications via RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>It is no news that we heavily rely on
<a href="http://odino.org/refactoring-your-architecture-go-for-soa/">RabbitMQ in our SOA</a>,
so it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that, to implement the notification service,
we send messages containing the notifications, that will
be intercepted by our notification service, which relies on
Notificator.</p>

<p>To do so, we take advantage of the great job done by
<a href="https://twitter.com/old_sound">Alvaro Videla</a>
on RabbitMQ for PHP and Symfony2, through the
<a href="https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib">PHP AMQP library</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/videlalvaro/RabbitMqBundle">RabbitMQ bundle</a>.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with them, you know that in order to consume messages,
you have to declare your consumer as a callback of the actual, generic
rabbitmq consumer, through the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<p>``` yaml app/config/config.yml
old_sound_rabbit_mq:</p>

<pre><code>consumers:
    notification:
        connection: default
        exchange_options: {name: 'notifications', type: direct}
        queue_options:    {name: 'notifications'}
        callback:         namshi.notification.consumer
</code></pre>

<p>services:</p>

<pre><code>namshi.notification.consumer:
    class: Namshi\Notificator\Messaging\RabbitMQ\Symfony2\Consumer
    arguments: [@namshi.notification.manager]
namshi.notification.manager:
    class: Namshi\Notificator\Manager
    calls:
      - [addhandler, [@namshi.notification.handler.notify_send] ]
namshi.notification.handler.notify_send:
    class: Namshi\Notificator\Notification\Handler\NotifySend
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We already provide a <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/blob/master/src/Namshi/Notificator/Messaging/RabbitMQ/Symfony2/Consumer.php">very basic consumer callback</a>
to be used with the RabbitMQ bundle.</p>

<p>The main idea behind this is that the publisher serializes the notification
and sends it through RabbitMQ, while the consumer unserializes and
triggers it through the <code>Manager</code>. The publisher code would be very, very simple:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>$publisher = $container->get(&lsquo;old_sound_rabbit_mq.notifications_producer&rsquo;);</p>

<p>$notification = new MySampleNotification(&ldquo;man, this comes from RabbitMQ and Symfony2!&rdquo;);</p>

<p>$publisher->publish(serialize($notification));
```</p>

<p>and to start consuming messages you would only need to
start the consumer:</p>

<p><code>
php app/console rabbitmq:consumer -w notification
</code></p>

<h2>FOSS</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to write a pretty extensive
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/">README</a> that you can use as a reference, on Github
(check the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/tree/master/tests">tests</a>, as well, to get an idea of the internals):
if you spot any typo or mistake, don&rsquo;t hesitate to
reach out and point it out.</p>

<p>This library is part of the efforts,
from <a href="https://github.com/namshi">Namshi</a>,
to be able to give back to the
OSS community as much as possible: you
are therefore strongly encouraged to open a PR
or express your opinion if you find that something
should be fixed or could be improved (there&rsquo;s a lot
of room for improvement, starting by implementing
many more <a href="https://github.com/namshi/notificator/tree/master/src/Namshi/Notificator/Notification/Handler">handlers</a>).</p>

    <link href="http://odino.org/configuring-a-symfony2-application-to-support-soa/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-06T13:00:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://odino.org/configuring-a-symfony2-application-to-support-soa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you think in terms of
<a href="/refactoring-your-architecture-go-for-soa/">Service Oriented Architecture</a>
one of the tricky things is to decide
how to organize your development workflow
in order to develop <strong>architecture</strong>,
not a single application: for example, how would
you configure deployments (when you need
to deploy <strong>part</strong> of your architecture, not
just a web application) or push cross-service
features to your SCM?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This article gives an overview of the constraints
and preferences that we wanted to implement
in our SOA, which is mainly done with Symfony2,
but most of it can be read in a
framework/language-agnostic key.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>We can at least identify 3 problems which pop
up after you decide to layer your architecture
and avoid <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/the-rocket-internet-experience-phptostart-2013-in-turin/103">a monolithic approach</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>given that every of your service will require
some time (1~5 minutes) to be deployed, how do you
ensure that you can release a new version of a service
without the need of updating <strong>all</strong> the other
services?
If you have, for example, 9 machines and 3 services
(A, B and C, 3 machines for each service),
you cant really afford to <strong>deploy everywhere</strong>
when you need to update just the service A, because
you might need to shutdown service B and C during the
deployment, while they dont really need to be updated.
The solution here would be to update just a bunch of
your servers</p></li>
<li><p>how do you create <em>Pull Requests</em> and organize your
repositories? This is not a trivial question: if you
need a feature that involves changes in services A and B,
and you have 2 repositories you will need to add some
overhead on top of every single operation that you
would usually do with a new feature</p></li>
<li><p>is your software able to automatically support SOA?
By this I mean, when you want to add a new service,
how easy is to configure your architecture to be able
to support the new layer? Of course, you would need
something that lets you do this in a matter of a minute</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Deployments</h2>

<p>As I stated earlier, the solution is to be able
to specify, upon deployments, which services need
to be updated, and your best friend, here, could
be something like <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a>.</p>

<p>If you ever worked with capistrano, you know
that deployments basically depend on the <code>deploy.rb</code> file,
in which you can configure different <strong>stages</strong> of your
architecture:</p>

<p><code>ruby
set :stages, %w(live staging)
set :default_stage, "staging"
require 'capistrano/ext/multistage'
</code></p>

<p>In the example, weare declaring that our application
can be deployed on 2 stages, <code>live</code> and <code>staging</code>; by doing a
<code>cap live deploy</code> or <code>cap deploy</code> you are ready to either deploy to your live
servers or staging ones, after configuring the staging
files (<code>live.rb</code> and <code>staging.rb</code>):</p>

<p>``` ruby An example live.rb
role :web,        &ldquo;company.com&rdquo;
role :app,        &ldquo;company.com&rdquo;, :primary => true
role :db,         &ldquo;company.com&rdquo;, :primary => true</p>

<p>set :app_environment, &ldquo;live&rdquo;
set :deploy_to,   &ldquo;/var/www/htdocs/#{application}.#{app_environment}&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>This still doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem of
<strong>just deploying a single service</strong>, but to
overcome it, thanks to the capistrano <code>multistage</code>
extension, it&rsquo;s a matter of configuring a few deployment
files.</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s how you would write your deployment
files once you have a couple services (<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>):</p>

<p><code>ruby deploy.rb
set :stages, %w(a-live a-staging b-live b-staging, live, staging)
set :default_stage, "staging"
require 'capistrano/ext/multistage'
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby a-live.rb
role :web,        &ldquo;a.company.com&rdquo;
role :app,        &ldquo;a.company.com&rdquo;, :primary => true
role :db,         &ldquo;a.company.com&rdquo;, :primary => true</p>

<p>set :app_environment, &ldquo;live&rdquo;
set :deploy_to,   &ldquo;/var/www/htdocs/#{application}.#{app_environment}&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>As you see, we are creating a few different stages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>serviceName-environment</code> (ie. a-live), which includes servers for a
specific environment of a service</li>
<li><code>environment</code> (ie. live), which includes the entire architecture,
useful in those cases when you really want to deploy
the entire architecture<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>For Symfony2, to ease your job, you can use
<a href="http://capifony.org/">capifony</a> which takes
care of configure the remaining,
specific, crucial parts of the deployment for the
framework (such as clearing and warming up the cache,
installing the dependencies via composer and so on).</p>

<h2>Software lifecycle</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/cylinders.png"></p>

<p>Ah, good old SCM problems!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say your are working on a traditional, monolithic application:
you branch to implement a new feature, commit, push, open
a pull request, the PR gets merged, deployed on staging, tested and
then goes to live; very simple as well as efficient:
<strong>zero overhead</strong>.</p>

<p>You might think that in SOAs this is not different: you <code>cd</code> into a
specific&rsquo;s service repository, branch to
implement a new feature, commit, push, open
a pull request, the PR gets merged in that repository, the service gets deployed
on its staging servers, tested and then goes to live;
very simple as well as efficient?</p>

<p>No, at all.</p>

<p>Thing is, often you will need to develop <strong>cross-service
features</strong>, which require code to be updated in N different
repositories: as a result, you will need to open N pull requests;
Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I would advice to keep all of your services under
one repositories, to avoid overheads:</p>

<ul>
<li>N projects in your IDE</li>
<li>N SCM operations (<code>git checkout -b myBranch</code> as well as <code>git push origin myBranch</code>)</li>
<li>N pull requests</li>
<li>N code reviews</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to this, honestly, I don&rsquo;t really see the need of separating services
into different repositories: when you deploy, you deploy a tag of the architecture
itself (only on the servers which host the services to be updated with that tag),
when you rollback, you rollback the entire architecture to a specific
version.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/baby-birds.jpg"></p>

<p>This seems to go against what I preached earlier, while talking
about deployments, but the truth is that you want to be on the safe side
once something goes wrong: you can optimize deployments so that you can
just deploy some services, but in case of rollback, you need to take an
immediate, &ldquo;total&rdquo; action to <strong>restore all of your services</strong>.</p>

<p>Consider the situation from a very similar perspective coming
from a very, very different context: cultivate an healthy colony of newborns
in nature &ndash; as opposed to maintaining an healthy architecture on the internets.</p>

<p>Exactly like the mom of newborn birds, when it comes to feed (update)
them, you would give the weaker ones, in order to help them develop as healthy
as their stronger brothers, the biggest meals; but when it comes
to rescue (rollback) them from a predator, you would crave for having an
option to move them all in one go, without the risk of moving them one by
one, leaving the unluckiest ones defenseless against their own fate.</p>

<h2>Configuring new services in Symfony2</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/cubic-architecture.jpg"></p>

<p>This post has to come to an end dealing with Symfony2,
since, in our experience,
<a href="/why-we-choose-symfony2-over-any-other-php-framework/">we have decided to go SOA with this framework</a>:
all in all, we found that due to the integration with capistrano
and the concept of bundles, together with the ability to have
per-bundle specific hostnames, this framework is pretty friendly
towards the ideas and constraints that we want to implement in
our SOA: what we&rsquo;ve seen is no rocket science, and even
the approach that we are using with Symfony2 is nothing
extraordinary, but it helps maintaining a very clean and
efficient workflow while developing a SOA.</p>

<p>As I said, for deploying you might want to use capifony,
and when it comes to isolate services in just one repository
we realized that a good solution would be to have <strong>one
Symfony2 application</strong> and create <strong>a bundle for each service</strong>
that we need.</p>

<p>Thanks for the capabilities of Symfony2&rsquo;s routing
mechanism, you can also bind a subdomain to a specific
bundle; once you create the bundle, you can tell symfony
that the routes of that specific bundle can be matched only
if the subdomain of the application matches a particular
string:</p>

<p>``` bash app/config/routing.yml
mycompany_service_a:</p>

<pre><code>resource: "@AcmeServiceABundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
prefix:   /
host:     service-a.mycompany.com
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>``` bash src/Acme/ServiceABundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
mycompany_service_a_index:</p>

<pre><code>pattern:  /index/{whateverParameter}
defaults: { _controller: AcmeServiceABundle:Default:index }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In this case, the route <code>mycompany_service_a_index</code> will only
be matched when the URL is using the hostname
<code>service-a.mycompany.com</code>: for example, <code>http://mycompany.com/index/param</code>
won&rsquo;t match it; this is pretty interesting since it gives you the
flexibility to develop features in just once repository, on
<strong>as many services as you want</strong>.</p>

<p>We are still heavily experimenting, but out of a few approaches &ndash;
for example <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/routing.html#prefixing-imported-routes">route prefixing</a> &ndash;
we decided to go on with the ones I explained here for cleanness,
clarity, efficiency and security of your development cycles
and architecture: if your experience suggests something different
or you want to share doubts, feel free to abuse of the comments
section, since I am very open and interested to discuss this topic.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-27T22:16:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://odino.org/why-we-choose-symfony2-over-any-other-php-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows that I am a big fan of the
Symfony2 ecosystem, and going SOA with
this framework was a very trivial decision
for us at <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a>;
all in all, besides personal preferences,
there is a plethora of reasons to choose
this framework among the others available
in PHP, so I am going to list the most
important factors that influenced our
decision.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, all of the following
factors matter <strong>first for the business</strong>,
then for the developers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Testing</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/behat.png"></p>

<p>We are firm believers in automated test practices,
and providing a layer that integrates very easily
with testing tools (such as Behat or PHPUnit) is a
must for us.</p>

<p>Symfony2 is a testing-prone framework because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is well decoupled, so <em>unit testing</em> becomes very easy
since you can mock objects, isolate classes and inject stub
dependencies very easily</li>
<li>it provides a first layer for functional testing (with PHPUnit):
being an HTTP-centric framework, it provides a <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/testing.html#your-first-functional-test">base class</a>
that lets you simulate HTTP requests and examine the output; needless
to say, these kind of tests are way faster than the ones that you
would write with tools like Selenium, since they don&rsquo;t have the
overhead of testing with an actual browser</li>
<li>there is a <a href="http://extensions.behat.org/symfony2/">Behat extension</a>
that lets you integrate the framework with this behavioral testing tool</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end, you can see how Symfony2 and the ecosystem around it
provide the proper toolset to run <strong>unit</strong>, <strong>functional</strong> and
<strong>behavioral</strong> tests.
If you do care about testing, this is already a
huge point: we can&rsquo;t afford our developers to <strong>waste</strong>
a huge portion of their time doing manual testing, and
we don&rsquo;t want to increase overhead to build a
manual QA team; since we are a technology startup,
we should take advantage of technology to automate
expensive tasks that harm the business, like
manual testing<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>I kind of had so much fun when, while still working
with symfony 1.4, I saw people developing with
frameworks like Yii or Zend Framework 1,
beating their heads on their desks tying to
understand which view to modify, var_dumping
SQL queries to output them and so on:
symfony 1.4 already had a very powerful
debug toolbar that would present all of these
informations in order to ease debugging.</p>

<p>Symfony2 goes beyond what we had before,
providing a way more powerful, extensible
toolbar and an integrated profiler.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/symfony2-profiler.png"></p>

<p>Database inspection will let you realize
how many queries you are running and see the
SQL of all of them, with a nice overview of the
time they take, while the profiler itself
includes informations about every step
of the application: for example, with Joomla,
can you tell this easily how long it took to
render a particular view and how much memory
was used to execute a controller&rsquo;s action?</p>

<p>Now, imagine each of your developers
(let&rsquo;s say you have a team of 6),
spending 1 hour (very conservative estimate)
out of 40 (a working week) trying to obtain
informations that debugging tools natively give you:
it&rsquo;s almost a day per week; multiply that day for 52
weeks in a year and you will end up loosing
one of your developers for two moths.</p>

<p>We <strong>all</strong> honestly can&rsquo;t afford to let a guy
leave the company for 2 months for free, so why
would we keep using counterproductive tools?</p>

<h2>Doctrine 2</h2>

<p>It is no news that we, at Namshi,
<a href="/refactoring-your-architecture-go-for-soa/">are working with a Service-Oriented Architecture</a>,
and we are highly benefiting from the easy
integration that Symfony2 provides for
Doctrine.</p>

<p>One of the rules of thumb of designing
SOAs is that you can provide access to the
same data source to different services:
in simple terms, instead of talking via
webservices or messaging queues, services
can simply access the data stored <em>somewhere</em>
by other ones.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/doctrine-cli.png"></p>

<p>Well, Doctrine 2 is the cherry on top of the
cake to access that <em>somewhere</em>: natively
providing support for multiple DB connections
and object-relational mappings, you can safely
use this tool, within Symfony2, to handle read
and writes to different databases without
polluting the domain model of each of the services
that take advantage of Doctrine; in addition to this,
I should enumerate the huge list of good things that
working with a data mapper like Doctrine 2 brings
on the table.</p>

<p>On another note, sharing the data model among different services
helps you overcoming though situations
where webservices or messaging queues are not
enough: think about a service which, due to
an update, needs to modify half a milion records
that &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to another service; of course,
istantly having 500k messages in a queue implies
a long, very long time to process them, while
a webservice might not be fully ok with sending
a huge payload over the HTTP protocol &ndash; and,
moreover, how do you start testing this feature,
when your developers need to send a lot of MB
through their browser? It is painful, believe me.</p>

<p>At this point, the ability of directly accessing
different DBs come out as a swiss-army knife, as
you can directly execute the 500k updates, in
batch, from the original service.</p>

<h2>Deployments</h2>

<p>Symfony2 has an <em>out of the box</em>
<a href="http://capifony.org/">integration with Capistrano</a>,
the most popular automated
deployment tool in the market.</p>

<p>This means that you should forget about
wasting time, money and energy to develop
your own in-house solution to automate
deployments or, even worse, rely on
manual procedure, which are prone to
errors where it hurts the most, on the
&ldquo;live server&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>DIC</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you, for example, are
using <a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog2</a>
to handle logs in your application:
while you are developing locally, you
won&rsquo;t have a graylog2 server to connect to,
since it might be that you want to keep
your machine a bit cleaner and you might
find more useful to read local logs
from a file in the filesystem, or directly
output them to the browser.</p>

<p>In Symfony2, thanks to the <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/master/book/service_container.html">dependency-injection container</a>,
you can define the logger as a service:</p>

<p>``` bash config.yml
logger:</p>

<pre><code>class: 'Monolog\Logger'
arguments:
    name:           "applicationName-%kernel.environment%"
calls:
    - [ pushHandler, [ @monolog_handler.graylog ] ]  
</code></pre>

<p>monolog_handler.graylog:</p>

<pre><code>class: 'Monolog\Handler\GelfHandler'
arguments:
    publisher: @gelf.message_publisher
    level:     200
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>and, for development environments, you
can simply override the configuration in
the <code>config_dev.yml</code> file:</p>

<p>``` bash config_dev.yml
monolog_handler.graylog:</p>

<pre><code>class: 'Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler'
arguments:
  stream: "php://stdout"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This will allow you to output errors that
would normally go to graylog2 directly to
the developer&rsquo;s browser, easing debugging
when you can afford to display errors in
the browser &ndash; thing that is not possible
who&rsquo;s viewing your application is a
potential customer.</p>

<p>Apart from all the technicalities involved
in using a DIC, I would like to focus on
one point: again, simplicity and speed to implement a
solution to a problem (having different log
handlers depending on the application&rsquo;s environment,
in this case) are a winning factor for your
development team, which is translated in <strong>more
productivity for your company</strong>.</p>

<h2>Bundles</h2>

<p>When we kickstarted our first Symfony2-based
service in our architecture, we decided to meld
together 2 applications that support our CRM
and ERP systems: being inside Symfony2, these
layers are <strong>fully isolated</strong> in separate bundles,
giving us the ability of phisically decoupling them
in 2 installations in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Bundles are probably one of the most powerful
concepts of Symfony2, since they are
micro-applications inside your main application:
being able to totally separate logics from different
domains helps you in keeping a clean separation
of concerns and autonomously develop every single
feature of your domain.</p>

<h2>Declarative code</h2>

<p>Consider the following snippet, written using the
<a href="http://symfony.com/doc/master/components/finder.html">Symfony2 Finder component</a>:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>use Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;
use Zend_Service_Amazon_S3 as Amazon_S3;</p>

<p>$s3 = new Amazon_S3($key, $secret);
$s3->registerStreamWrapper(&ldquo;s3&rdquo;);</p>

<p>$finder = new Finder();
$finder->name(&lsquo;photos*&rsquo;)&ndash;>size(&lsquo;&lt; 100K&rsquo;)&ndash;>date(&lsquo;since 1 hour ago&rsquo;);</p>

<p>foreach ($finder->in(&lsquo;s3://bucket-name&rsquo;) as $file) {</p>

<pre><code>print $file-&gt;getFilename();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>After your <strong>first</strong> look at this code, you already know
what it is doing: now imagine that your team of developers
need to, instead, try to understand how the Drupal
framework works.</p>

<p>Taken from <a href="https://github.com/drupal/drupal/blob/7.x/modules/comment/comment.admin.inc#L271">Drupal&rsquo;s source code</a>:</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>/<em>*
 * Process comment_confirm_delete form submissions.
 </em>/
function comment_confirm_delete_submit($form, &amp;$form_state) {
  $comment = $form[&lsquo;#comment&rsquo;];
  // Delete the comment and its replies.
  comment_delete($comment->cid);
  drupal_set_message(t(&lsquo;The comment and all its replies have been deleted.&rsquo;));
  watchdog(&lsquo;content&rsquo;, &lsquo;Deleted comment @cid and its replies.&rsquo;, array(&lsquo;@cid&rsquo; => $comment->cid));
  // Clear the cache so an anonymous user sees that his comment was deleted.
  cache_clear_all();</p>

<p>  $form_state[&lsquo;redirect&rsquo;] = &ldquo;node/$comment->nid&rdquo;;
}
```</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m far from saying that Drupal sucks, but some
questions rise into my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>why do I have a <code>$form</code> and a separate <code>$form_state</code>?</li>
<li>what is <code>watchdog()</code> doing? Is it used for
logging? Or to display flash messages?</li>
<li>what is a <code>cid</code>? And what about the <code>nid</code>?</li>
<li>why should I clear my entire application&rsquo;s
cache to notify a user of a change?</li>
</ul>


<p>See, you don&rsquo;t want your developers to have to go
through an entire application to understand what
a piece of code does.</p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>

<p>Symfony2 is a framework made to take advantage
of clean and clear tested patterns as well as
tools to improve the final developer&rsquo;s
productivity: imagine your team, working
six months on this framework; how much would
they learn? How many structural changes
would they be able to do on your application without
introducing regressions?</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/best-practice.jpg"></p>

<p>For startups, by the way, a huge plus comes from
the fact that being highly decoupled, Symfony2 helps
when you want to drastically replace a piece of software,
or an adapter, with another one: for example,
thanks to the dependency-injection container,
you would be able to replace application services
with others that have the same API, but a different
implementation.</p>

<p>It is clear enough that Symfony2 provides the
flexibility you need to reach a very short
<em>time to market</em> and increases your developers'
awareness and efficiency by giving them the
guidance and the tools they need to care about
the domain of your services and not about how
many bugs they would introduce by changing an
untested piece of code.</p>

<h2>All in all&hellip;is it Symfony2?</h2>

<p>A very simple question that you should ask
yourself at the end of this reading is:
but, all in all, is this all thanks to
Symfony2 or its surrounding environment?</p>

<p>It is its surrounding environment, which
was born thanks to the framework itself:
when Symfony2 was released, no other framework
had the same level of quality that the open source
product from SensioLabs could offer;
a natural effect of this was that the
majority of well-known open source
PHP developers got amused by this framework
and embraced its way.</p>

<p>Basically, Symfony2 is a framework chosen by
the community, thus it can take advantage of
all the efforts of the OS developers around it:
from automated deployment tools to fully integrated
ORMs, from testing frameworks to tutorials
and best practices, through native, advanced
debugging tools, Symfony2 is, as of today the most
complete framework available in the PHP ecosystem
when you take in consideration learning curve,
integrations, stability and performances (don&rsquo;t forget
that one of <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/4/2/youporn-targeting-200-million-views-a-day-and-beyond.html">top 100 website in the Alexa rank</a>
is powered by Symfony2<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Can other frameworks do all of this?</p>

<p>For the benefit of your <strong>business</strong>, this
is the main question that you should ask
yourself.</p>

catastrophe happens), you should help people
is easing their job while testing.</p>

<p>Today I am going to show the approach that
we just kickstarted, at Namshi, in order to
help designers and developers testing
frontend changes in a more automated, thus
easier, way.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/NamshiVoyeurBundle">NamshiVoyeurBundle</a>,
it is really easy to start increasing
the efficiency of your testing department,
even if coders do not want to write
automated tests.</p>

<p>The bundle, that you can use <strong>inside a Symfony2
application</strong>, is actually very small and can be
extrapolated to be integrated in other frameworks
(like ZF2 or Cake).</p>

<p>The idea is very simple: you take some screenshots
of a website, deploy a new version, take another set of
screenshots (at the same URLs) and then compare
them, generating an image diff.</p>

<p>After you install the <code>NamshiVoyeurBundle</code> (via composer),
it is really easy to start taking screenshots;
you just have to configure a few services
and some parameters:</p>

<p>```yml Configuring the bundle
parameters:</p>

<pre><code>namshi_voyeur:
  browsers:
    - firefox
    - safari
    - chrome
  urls:
    homepage:     "/"
    new-arrivals: "new-products"
    women:        "women-shoes"
  shots_dir: "/Users/you/Downloads/screenshots"
  base_url:       "http://en-ae.namshi.com/"
</code></pre>

<p>services:</p>

<pre><code>safari:
    class:  Behat\Mink\Driver\Selenium2Driver
    calls:
      - [start]
    arguments:
      browser: safari
firefox:
    class:  Behat\Mink\Driver\Selenium2Driver
    calls:
      - [start]
chrome:
    class:  Behat\Mink\Driver\Selenium2Driver
    calls:
      - [start]
    arguments:
      browser: chrome
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This configuration basically tells Voyeur that
you will be taking screenshots of three URLs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://en-ae.namshi.com/</code></li>
<li><code>http://en-ae.namshi.com/new-products</code></li>
<li><code>http://en-ae.namshi.com/women-shoes</code></li>
</ul>


<p>with safari, firefox and google chrome.</p>

<p>To run the Voyeur, use the <code>cli</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
php app/console namshi:voyeur
</code></p>

<p>Screenshots will be saved at <code>/Users/you/Downloads/screenshots</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, after you deployed a new version of the code,
run the Voyeur again, and you will be reay to generate the
diffs between the screenshots:</p>

<p><code>bash
php app/console namshi:voyeur:diff /Users/you/Downloads/screenshots/firefox/2013/03/10/1200 /Users/you/Downloads/screenshots/firefox/2013/03/10/1205
</code></p>

<p>Diffs will be generated at <code>/Users/you/Downloads/screenshots/firefox/2013/03/10/1205/diff</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it: now you can start having a look at what changed and
ask your developers to do the same, even on their local
machine, before committing any changes.</p>
