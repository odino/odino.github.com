<p>In 2009 I abandoned it because I had so much pain in the *** trying to fit this product to customers&#8217; needs and, other big reason, because I lost enthusiasm on developing on such this kind of platform.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Seriously, no fun at all after a few months I worked with it.</p>

<p>Seriously, I wrote a few extensions I&rsquo;m not proud of. <strong>At all</strong>.</p>

<p>So, as you might understand, I need to reveal a big disclaimer before digging into this post: it&rsquo;s been a while I don&rsquo;t use Joomla! in production and I didn&rsquo;t even used the 1.6 version, which had some cool features the 1.5 series lacked of.</p>

<p>But I always followed the project, as an external watcher, in order to understand where it was going, its aims, its gotchas and so on.</p>

<p>I love the idea behind this CMS, but I hate how it is implemented and the way the entire project is handled.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why, in the title of my post, I put a couple <em>sucks</em>: since I don&rsquo;t want to bitch around offending a good product with a great community, I&rsquo;ll analyze the motivations that led me to think Joomla! sucks hard and I could not use it for my projects, those I made with my former company ( and it was my company ) and those we are manufacturing in <a href="http://www.dnsee.com/">DNSEE</a>.</p>

<h2>All the way with Django</h2>

<p>I was fascinated by a talk entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/37113340/Why-Django-Sucks-and-How-we-Can-Fix-it">Why Django sucks, and how We can fix it</a>&rdquo;, because it had a purpose: highlighting the bad and the evil of the framework providing some proposals to fix them.</p>

<p>So I will take inspiration from that talk so you will read about:</p>

<ul>
<li>things that suck in Joomla!</li>
<li>why they suck</li>
<li>how to fix them</li>
</ul>


<h2>Joomla!</h2>

<p>As you might know, Joomla! is a fork of a procedural crap called <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a>, an <em>en-vogue</em> CMS during the old fashion age of <strong>PHP 4</strong>, when men were living in caves and, if you were a woman, your job was picking up berries from the woods near to your own cave, while your man was out, hunting mammoths.</p>

<p>At that time, PHP solutions were not properly engineered and a lot of concepts, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">SoC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a> [<em>insert every kind of goodness we have nowaday here</em>] were missing.</p>

<p>So we had <strong>Joomla! 1.0</strong>, a political fork of Mambo ( and the DevTeam had the right reasons to fork it ) which was, basically, Mambo with a different name.</p>

<p>In 2008 we had <strong>Joomla! 1.5</strong>, an almost-completely rewritten version of the CMS, with a new framework, still supporting some legacy stuff but better engineered, althought still crappy.</p>

<h2>Joomla! 1.5 and 1.6: what a mess!</h2>

<p>If we consider Joomla! 1.5/6 we agree on the fact that it&rsquo;s not properly engineered or, better, not as engineered as its community claims it is.</p>

<p>First of all you notice that there is no decent abstraction layer for the DB: only 2 PDOs are supported, <a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/releases/1.5/libraries/joomla/database/database/">Mysql and Mysqli</a>, so you can basically just install Joomla! with MySQL.</p>

<p>Looking at the tests of the framework, you can see that in the version 1.5 the <a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/releases/1.5/tests/unit/suite/">code coverage of the framework was very weak</a>, while in 1.6 they <a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/trunk/tests/unit/">improved it</a>: the ugly thing is that ots of &ldquo;unit&rdquo; test are not that <em>unit</em>](<a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/trunk/tests/unit/suite/libraries/joomla/form/JFormDataHelper.php">http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/trunk/tests/unit/suite/libraries/joomla/form/JFormDataHelper.php</a>).</p>

<p>You can also find other masterpieces of the software right around: for example <a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/trunk/components/com_content/helpers/query.php">helpers which handle models&#8217; responsabilities</a>. Not even MVC.</p>

<p>Again, <strong>not even MVC</strong>.</p>

<p>And then, again, no decent abstraction on the core components of a framework/cms, like HTTP requests ( <a href="http://joomlacode.org/svn/joomla/development/trunk/components/com_content/controller.php">$_SERVER is so 2003</a> ).</p>

<h2>The golden age which started from the 1.6 series</h2>

<p>Now we have Joomla! 1.6 and will have a newer version of Joomla! every six months ( like Ubuntu ): the DevTeam decided to separate the framework from the actual CMS, so they invented the Joomla! platform, because, you know, it&rsquo;s nice to have a clear separation between the foundation of your product and the product itself.</p>

<p>But the question is not &ldquo;<strong>Why</strong> did they do this?&rdquo;, because I fully agree with that decision: the real question is <strong>How?</strong>.</p>

<p>And here comes the hard part.</p>

<h2>The Joomla! Platform</h2>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform">Joomla! Platform</a> on GitHub you will see a few things that I still can&rsquo;t believe they could be included in a &ldquo;framework&rdquo;.</p>

<p>No namespaces, no standardization of the <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/loader.php">autoloading</a> through the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal">PSR0</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>And other stuff that I want to spend a few lines on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/factory.php">Factory</a> is really a good design pattern, but you should couple it with DI and, if needed a DI container</li>
<li>Do we really need such this kind of code in every file? <code>defined('JPATH_PLATFORM') or die;</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/access/access.php">static methods are everywhere</a> and, oh my, there are even methods that <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/database/table.php#L924">spend a few lines in order to inspect if they live in a static context or not</a></li>
<li>lack of abstraction is well expressed when <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/database/table.php#L963">a Table object ( DB-related ) throws a generic exception</a>: how the hell a coder can extend this code implementing fault-tolerance?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/document/document.php#L196">methods embarrassing themselves</a></li>
<li>dependency injection <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/session/session.php#L446">heavily ignored</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/blob/master/libraries/joomla/form/form.php">useless pieces of code</a> already written &ndash; better &ndash; by Zend Framework and Symfony</li>
</ul>


<p>Besides all of this, why do we need <strong>just another framework</strong>?</p>

<p>It is obvious that if we consider the evolution from Mambo to Joomla! 1.6 the road has been cool and long, mostly succesfull ( for <strong>Joomla!, the brand</strong> ) but the product had to face a tremendous slow down of the development process, internal quality and so on.</p>

<p>Internal quality is the biggest problem I&rsquo;m considering now, because it&rsquo;s the quality of a software which makes the software itself evolve faster/slower, without/with pain in the ass.</p>

<p>The quality of Joomla! CMS and the platform is not that good and the biggest problem is that we should not expect something well-engineered from people stucked on the old PHP world.</p>

<p>And stucked to some idiotic ideas like <a href="http://people.joomla.org/groups/viewdiscussion/634-a-framework-i-mean-a-real-framework.html?groupid=630">re-inventing the software is really cool, because other&rsquo;s sw is crap</a>.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the points I highlight in my post on people.joomla.org you&rsquo;ll notice that:</p>

<ul>
<li>people think Joomla! is the coolest software on the planet, and the Joomla! community can make great things</li>
<li>after I point out some problems, people recognizes that there is something evil in this way of managing a software</li>
<li>after that, the excuse is to bring feelings into the battlefield:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>I could go through the rest of what you&#8217;ve mentioned, but I don&#8217;t think that it is helpfull.<br/>Mainly because I&#8217;m most likely wrong, but will defend all this to the blood because I&#8217;m emotionally attached to it. ;-)</p></blockquote>


<p>Seriously, guys?</p>

<h2>Steal&hellip; I mean, reuse, or fork if you need to!</h2>

<p>So after saying really ugly things on this wonderful CMS and its community, it&rsquo;s time to throw a solution, the solution I recommend, into this post: <strong>stealing code</strong>.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.symfony.com/">Symfony</a>: it all started before 2007 ( so before Joomla! 1.5 ), when Fabien Potencier decided to fork the Mojavi<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> framework1 and expand it integrating a few other libraries, like some parts of the Zend Framework, Prado and so on.</p>

<p>Since Fabien isn&rsquo;t stupid, he took the best from a few projects to deliver one of the first real RAD frameworks for PHP, and after doing that, he took inspiration from Spring to re-engineer &ldquo;his&rdquo; framework and deliver Symfony2 ( which is in RC4 now ): also Symfony2 likes to steal code; for example, the logging aspect is handled with <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog">Monolog</a>.</p>

<p>Not only code, that&rsquo;s obvious: Symfony2 has also stolen a 10 years old specification, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang">ESI</a> language one, in order to spare development time and teach people that HTTP cache is almost <strong>total</strong>.</p>

<p>But as you probably know, I&rsquo;m not really talking about stealing actual things, but rather about taking inspiration about good ideas and re-using great products to speed up our development process and deliver better software.</p>

<p><strong>Look, try, re-use</strong>: that should be the motto for the Joomla! core team.</p>
