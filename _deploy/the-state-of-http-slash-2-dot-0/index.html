<div class="entry-content"><p>With a few days of delay I&rsquo;m here reporting and commenting
the last <strong>revolutions</strong> about the protocol of the web,
its upcoming groundbreaking new version and its state.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few days back <a href="http://www.mnot.net/">Mark Nottingham</a> announced that the
group is <a href="https://twitter.com/mnot/status/253175410383278081">officially working on the new draft of <code>HTTP/2.0</code></a>:
even though rumors about the shape of this new version were
going on since a couple years, this <strong>official</strong>
news brings some fresh hope on the topic.</p>

<p>As the HTTP protocol was always directly influenced
by great minds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy Fielding</a>, just
to mention a couple names) when I first heard about
Mark taking the responsability to publish <code>HTTP/2.0</code> I
was pretty sure something great would have come out of
his mind.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 13 years since HTTP doesnt see a major change
in its specification (recent changes are the addition of
the <code>PATCH</code> method, for example, but we&rsquo;re talking about
<strong>minor</strong> stuff) and SPDY &ndash; a new protocol created by Google &ndash;
came out in the recent history of the web with a disruptive
force.</p>

<p>HTTP needed something.</p>

<h2>SPDY</h2>

<p>But before having a look at what <code>HTTP/2.0</code> will look like,
let&rsquo;s mention the good things that SPDY brings on the table:</p>

<ul>
<li>prioritization: it allows to send different requests and
tell the server to prioritize some of them</li>
<li>multiplexing: allows parallel requests and asynchronous
responses, unlike <em>pipelining</em> which is bound to multiple
requests/responses at the same time</li>
<li>server push: servers can now push resources to the client
without them having to ask for</li>
<li>better performances: extended compression is one of the
key FTW of SPDY</li>
</ul>


<p>But there is one things that SPDY doesn&rsquo;t change at all:
the <strong>interface</strong> between the machines.</p>

<p>As recognized worldwide, the HTTP protocol was an almost
perfect example of M2M interface which allows servers
and clients to follow DAPs (<em>domain-application protocols</em>)
according to a loosely coupled interface &ndash; the protocol itself,
with its verbs, semantics and workflows<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So SPDY, recognizing the perfection of the contract that HTTP
puts among clients and servers, isn&rsquo;t a real new protocol, it&rsquo;s
a <strong>better implementation of the same interface</strong>.</p>

<h2>HTTP/2.0 is an evolution of an evolution</h2>

<p>No wonder, then, in reading the words of Nottingham, as, after
all, he &ldquo;just&rdquo; announced that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2012OctDec/0004.html"><code>HTTP/2.0</code> will be <strong>based on SPDY</strong></a>:
a great news that is basically telling you the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel&rdquo;
principle is even applied at the foundation of the web<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The layers will definitely be different, but, again, I think
that having a newer version of our beloved protocol, based on a
specification which already improves it and adds tons of new and
interesting features, is going to be <strong>a game-changer for web
applications</strong>.</p>

<p>Will we see <code>HTTP/2.0</code> being deployed with multiplexing, server push,
prioritization and extended compression next year?</p>

        <li id='fn:1'>No wonder why Roy Fielding, after having heavily influenced the HTTP protocol and the Apache ecosystem, came out with REST, an architectural style meant for long-living and scalable architectures <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li><li id='fn:2'>So, think about it, why do you need to re-write huge portions of code when better FOSS is out there? <a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li>
