<p>I recently gave another read at my original post &ldquo;<a href="http://odino.org/rest-better-http-cache/">REST better: HTTP cache</a>&rdquo;
and I felt compelled to write a more in-depth dive into the subject, especially since it&rsquo;s
one of the most popular topics in this blog; at the same time, with the advent of
new technologies such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers">sevice workers</a>, people jumped into the bandwagon of
offline applications without, in my opinion, understanding that the HTTP cache
provides some basic but extremely interesting features for offline experiences
&mdash; thus, I want to shed some light on one of the most ingenious sections of the
HTTP protocol.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What is the HTTP cache?</h2>

<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s start by dividing HTTP into 2 entities:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt">spec</a><sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>, which highlights how messages can be exchanged between clients and servers</li>
<li>the implementation (for example, Google Chrome is an HTTP client, Nginx implements an HTTP server and so on)</li>
</ul>


<p>So, for example, with HTTP/2 we have seen a revamped <em>implementation</em>, one that
brings TSL by default, that turned plaintext messages (the way messages were exchanged
in HTTP/1) into binary, along with the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing">multiplexing</a>
(in short: one connection can channel multiple requests and responses) and the
likes &mdash; HTTP/2 was a massive upgrade to HTTP and is making the web a much
safer, faster place. At the same time, <strong>the spec itself didn&rsquo;t change as much</strong>, as
the semantics of the protocol have been widely unaffected by HTTP/2.</p>

<p>HTTP caching falls under the HTTP spec, as it&rsquo;s simply a chapter that defines how messages can be cached by both clients &amp; servers: the current
version of the HTTP caching spec is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234">RFC7234</a>,
so you can always head there and have a look by yourself.</p>

<p>The goal of the HTTP caching spec is, in short, to:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] significantly improve performance by reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current request.</p><footer><strong>RFC7234</strong> <cite><a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234'>tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>or, as <a href="https://tomayko.com/">some smart guy</a> once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] never generate the same response twice</p><footer><strong>Ryan Tomayko</strong> <cite><a href='https://tomayko.com/blog/2008/rack-cache-announce'>Introducing Rack Cache</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the HTTP cache is there so that we hit servers as less
as possible'>
As you might have guessed, the HTTP cache is there so that we hit servers as less
as possible: if we can re-use an existing response, why sending a request to the
origin server? The request needs to cross the network (slow, and TCP is a &ldquo;heavy&rdquo;
protocol), hit the origin server (which could do better without the additional load)
and come back to the client. <em>No bueno:</em> if we can avoid all of that we, first of
all, take a huge burden off our servers and, second, make the web faster, as clients
don&rsquo;t need to travel through the network to get the information they need.</p>

<p>A side effect of HTTP caching is the fact that it makes the web inconsistent: a
resource might have changed and, by serving a cached, stale version of it we don&rsquo;t
feed the clients the latest version: this is, generally, an acceptable
compromise we, as developers, make in order to scale better. In addition, these
inconsistencies can be avoided by tweaking the <em>cacheability</em> of our responses, and
we will look at how to do that in the next paragraphs.</p>

<p>In defining mechanisms to implement this kind of performance optimizations, the
W3C working group split caching into 2 main variants: <strong>expiration</strong>, which is simpler
but very high-level, and <strong>validation</strong>, which gives you more granularity.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at expiration first, as it&rsquo;s the way we use HTTP caching on a daily
basis.
</span></p>

<h2>Expiration</h2>

<p>This is the sort of caching you&rsquo;re used to see every day, which allows you to specify TTLs
(<em>time to live</em>) for static assets like JS, CSS &amp; the likes: we know those assets
are cacheable for a long time, so we specify an expiration date on those resources.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, expiration is generally used for static assets, but can be used
for any kind of resource (ie. <code>GET /news/1</code>), so don&rsquo;t just think caching is for
content that never changes (such as a minified JS file).</p>

<p>How can we implement expiration though? Through 2 very simple HTTP headers.</p>

<h3>Expires</h3>

<p>The <code>Expires</code> HTTP header allows  us to specify a future date that defines until
when a resource should be cacheable:</p>

<p><img class="center nobo" src="/images/expires.png"></p>

<p>If the client needs to fetch the same resources later on, it will first figure out
if it has expired and, if not, use the local copy stored in the cache, without
hitting the origin server. An example implementation might look like:</p>

<p>This is a very simplistic implementation, but should give you an idea of the
process an <em>HTTP intermediary</em> (a browser, a proxy, etc) goes through when
implementing basic HTTP cache through the <code>Expires</code> header.</p>

<h3>Cache-Control</h3>

<p>If we want to get a bit fancier, we can use the <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which allows
us more control over how a response should be cached; for example, here&rsquo;s an HTTP
response using <code>Cache-Control</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</span><span class='line'>Content-Type: application/json
</span><span class='line'>Content-Length: ...
</span><span class='line'>Cache-Control: public, max-age<span class="o">=</span>3600, s-maxage<span class="o">=</span>60, stale-if-error<span class="o">=</span>600, no-transform
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>// ...JS content here...
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to process, so let&rsquo;s break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cache-Control</code> allows you to embed multiple caching directives into one header</li>
<li>directives are comma separated</li>
<li>in most cases, directives are parsed as key-value pairs (ie. <code>key=val</code>) &mdash; some of them, though, require no value (ie. <code>no-transform</code>)</li>
<li>they control different aspects of the cacheability of a resource</li>
</ul>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Most people think that the Cache-Control is a response header, whereas it can be
included in HTTP requests as well'>
So what directives can we use in here?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>public</code>, which means that the resource can be cached by <em>any</em> cache (read on)</li>
<li><code>private</code>, which means that the resource can only be cached if the cache is not shared. <strong>A browser is a private cache</strong>, while <strong>a proxy is a shared cache</strong>, as it channels requests and responses from and to multiple clients. For example, the resource at <code>GET /customers/me</code> could possibly be cached by private caches (my own browser), but not by shared caches, as they would end up showing my user profile information to
other users</li>
<li><code>max-age</code>, the TTL, in seconds, of the resource. <code>max-age=60</code> means it is cacheable for 1 minute</li>
<li><code>s-maxage</code>, which is exactly like <code>max-age</code> but applies to shared caches only (hence the <code>s-</code> prefix)</li>
<li><code>must-revalidate</code>, which indicates that once the resource is stale, the cache should not serve it without first re-validating it with the server</li>
<li><code>proxy-revalidate</code>, same as <code>must-revalidate</code> but for shared caches</li>
<li><code>no-cache</code> tells the cache it always needs to revalidate the resource with the origin server</li>
<li><code>no-store</code>, which means you should not cache the resource at all</li>
<li><code>no-transform</code> says the intermediary should not toy around with the response payload at all (I&rsquo;ve never seen intermediaries doing so, so I&rsquo;m assuming this is how most softwares like browsers or gateway caches behave by default)</li>
</ul>


<p>Most people think that the Cache-Control is a response header, whereas it can be
included in HTTP requests as well &mdash; and the directives you can use are slightly
different:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>max-age</code>: the client will discard responses with an <code>Age</code> header older than the value of this directive</li>
<li><code>max-stale</code>: here the client advertises that if the server is willing to serve a stale response (to avoid hitting the DB, for example) it can do so as long as the response is not older than the value of the directive (ie. <code>max-stale=60</code>). This is a very clever mechanism to allow servers to do less work!</li>
<li><code>mix-fresh</code>: the opposite of <code>max-stale</code>. The client will accept cached responses only if they&rsquo;re fresher than this value</li>
<li><code>no-cache</code>: don&rsquo;t even try&hellip; :)</li>
<li><code>no-transform</code>: same meaning that it would have in an HTTP response</li>
<li><code>only-if-cached</code>: the client will only accept cached responses
</span></li>
</ul>


<h3>Stale-* directives</h3>

<p>An ingenious trick, the <code>stale-while-revalidate</code> and <code>stale-if-error</code> cache-control
directives are worth a mention on their own, as what they let you achieve is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861">pretty
interesting</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>stale-if-error</code> tells the cache that it can serve a cached response if, by any chance, it encounters an error when fetching a fresh response from the origin server. In other words, this means that an HTTP cache can be smart enough to serve cached content when you server starts returning 500 errors &mdash; talk about fault tolerance!</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center nobo" src="/images/stale-if-error.png"></p>

<ul>
<li><code>stale-while-revalidate</code> lets you serve cached content while refreshing the cache instead. This is fairly interesting as, if 100 clients are accessing your cache at <em>T0</em>, you can serve them a cached resource at <em>T1</em> (even if it&rsquo;s  stale), while revalidating the cache in background. If a client then requests the same resource at <em>T2</em>, he will receive the version that&rsquo;s been revalidated from the origin server</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center nobo" src="/images/stale-while-revalidate.png"></p>

<p>Funny enough, <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/01/chrome_and_stale-while-revalidate">Chrome has been considering implementing this directive</a> for quite
some time, and last I heard it was still just <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5050913014153216">under consideration</a>,
though it looks like <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=348877#c68">it might never going to make it to Chrome Stable</a>.</p>

<h3>Pragma: an obsolete header you&rsquo;ll still see around</h3>

<p><code>Cache-Control</code> was introduced in HTTP/1.1, meaning there had to be some way to
control caches in the olden HTTP/1.0 days &mdash; that would be
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.4">Pragma header</a>.</p>

<p><code>Pragma</code> doesn&rsquo;t let you do much, as you can just tell caches not to cache through
<code>Pragma: no-cache</code> &mdash; nothing too complicated here.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, though, is that a few HTTP clients will still consider responses
cacheable if they don&rsquo;t see a <code>no-cache</code> in the <code>Pragma</code>, and so the best practice
to avoid caching has been to send both <code>Cache-Control</code> and <code>Pragma</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
</span><span class='line'>Cache-Control: no-cache
</span><span class='line'>Pragma: no-cache
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At the same time, a peculiar use of Pragma is by telling HTTP/1.0 caches not to
cache (via <code>Pragma</code>) while allowing HTTP/1.1 caches to do so (via <code>Cache-Control</code>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
</span><span class='line'>Cache-Control: max-age<span class="o">=</span>3600
</span><span class='line'>Pragma: no-cache
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Enough with expiration</strong>: it&rsquo;s now time to move on to validation, a more expensive
but granular way to implement HTTP caching.</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>Expiration provides a very interesting way to keep clients off the server, at the
cost of serving stale content more often than we&rsquo;d might like: in cases when that&rsquo;s
not an acceptable compromise you can use <strong>validation</strong>, as it ensures clients will
always be able to receive the latest, most fresh version of a resource.</p>

<p><img class="right nobo" src="/images/if-none.png"></p>

<p>At its core, validation works in a very simple manner: when you request a resource,
the server assigns a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; to it (let&rsquo;s say <code>v1</code>) and the next time you request the
same resource you include the tag in your request; the server, at this point, can
quickly check if the resource has changed: if so, it returns the new version, else
it tells you to use the cached version you should have with you.</p>

<p>In HTTP words this is how it basically works:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Response if the content is the same</span>
</span><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you see, returning a <code>304 Not Modified</code> is cheaper as it doesn&rsquo;t contain as many
information as the &ldquo;real&rdquo; resource: less packets traveling through the network, thus
a faster response.</p>

<p>At the same time, calculating an <code>Etag</code> (the HTTP header used to tag resources) is
generally cheaper than rendering your resource again &mdash; let&rsquo;s look at some pseudo-code
to understand what we&rsquo;re talking about:</p>

<p>We have saved the server some extra work by not rendering the news template all
over again: this might feel like a small saving, but put it in the context of
thousands of requests every day and you see where we&rsquo;re going.</p>

<p>Looking back at our second request:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>GET /news/1 HTTP/1.1
</span><span class='line'>If-None-Match: 1234
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>you might be wondering what&rsquo;s that <code>If-None-Match</code>, so let me break the whole
process down for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>client requests a resource</li>
<li>server returns it and tags it with the <code>Etag</code> header</li>
<li>client requests the same resource again, and tells the server to return it only if the resource&rsquo;s etag doesnt match the one we&rsquo;re sending (that&rsquo;s why the header is called <code>If-None-Match</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>A request that contains the <code>If-None-Match</code> header is called a &ldquo;conditional request&rdquo;:
it&rsquo;s expected to fetch a resource only if the condition it is sending
won&rsquo;t be satisfied (the condition is that the client&rsquo;s etag matches the server&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>Conditional requests and validation can be implemented with etags as well as dates:
if you&rsquo;re more comfortable using the latter (think of an <code>updated_at</code> column in the DB)
you can replace <code>Etag</code> with <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> with <code>If-Modified-Since</code>:</p>

<p>Again, the spec is very simple and doesn&rsquo;t get too fancy, yet it&rsquo;s powerful enough
to let you save so much time and data by returning <code>304</code> rather than &ldquo;full&rdquo; responses &mdash;
that&rsquo;s why I like the HTTP caching spec: it&rsquo;s so clever and simple!</p>

<h2>Who can cache my responses?</h2>

<p>HTTP is a layered protocol, meaning there can be countless intermediaries between
the client and the server &mdash; a picture is worth
a thousand words:</p>

<p><img class="center nobo" src="/images/types-caches.png"></p>

<p>So, who are all these guys that can cache resources all along the way?</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing to explain in terms of <strong>browsers</strong>, as we&rsquo;re all familiar with them.
Worth to note that, when you use <code>curl</code> from your command-line, that&rsquo;s your browser</li>
<li><strong>proxies</strong>, instead, are generally installed between the client and the internet,
and they provide a shield between the two. Proxies are shared caches as, for example,
you could install them at your company so that multiple browsers use the same proxy
&mdash; that way, if I request a cacheable resource and one of my co-workers requests the
same, he will be served the cached response I generated, by the proxy</li>
<li><strong>ISPs / the internet</strong>: well, that&rsquo;s the backbone of your internet connection, and
they could implement caching on their own</li>
<li>proxies installed on the server-side are called <strong>reverse proxies</strong> instead,
as their job is to shield multiple servers from requests. Reverse proxies are also
called &ldquo;HTTP accelerators&rdquo;, as their main job is to avoid requests from hitting
the origin servers. <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> is one of the most popular reverse proxies out there</li>
<li>last but not least you&rsquo;ve got your <strong>origin servers</strong>, where your applications
run. They can implement HTTP caching on their own, even though it&rsquo;s generally
preferred to have a dedicated reverse proxy to offload origins</li>
</ul>


<h2>Warning: when things don&rsquo;t go as planned&hellip;</h2>

<p>An interesting header is <code>Warning</code>, as it&rsquo;s used to signal that <em>something went wrong</em>
when fetching the response from the upstream, something that&rsquo;s hard to infer from the HTTP status code
alone: for example, when the cache knows that the response being served is stale, it
could include a <code>Warning: 110 - "Response is Stale"</code> to inform the client that the response
he&rsquo;s receiving isn&rsquo;t fresh at all &mdash; that, for example, could happen when <code>stale-while-revalidate</code>
or <code>stale-if-error</code> kick in:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># The HTTP status code says everything&#39;s good,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># but the warning header tells the client the</span>

</span><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
</span><span class='line'>Warning: 110 - <span class="s2">&quot;Response is Stale&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>A note on Service Workers</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='if all you need is caching static assets or do expiration-based
caching, do not use service workers as the HTTP cache gets the same job done'>
Here comes the fun part: if you&rsquo;re a web developer chances are you&rsquo;ve heard you
should implement service workers in order to efficiently serve cached content, and
<strong>that&rsquo;s quite misleading</strong> &mdash; to be clear, you can have offline apps working
without service workers, as when you tap on a link and that renders a response with,
say, <code>Cache-Control: max-age=3600</code>, you can still open that page for another hour,
without an internet connection.</p>

<p>Service workers give you a great deal of control on the network stack, allowing you
to intercept HTTP requests being made, hijack them and, as many advise, cache them
on-the-fly &mdash; but I&rsquo;d honestly avoid doing so as you can achieve the exact same thing
with the HTTP cache and way less code.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase it: if all you need is caching static assets or do expiration-based
caching, do not use service workers as the HTTP cache gets the same job done. If you need some special functionality
that is not included in the caching spec, then use a worker, but I&rsquo;d be very surprised
to hear you needed to: the contexts where you would be able to take advantage of the
SW&rsquo;s capabilities are quite advanced, and I could argue HTTP caching would anyhow
get you ~95% there even in those cases.
</span></p>

<p><img class="right nobo" src="/images/99-devs.png"></p>

<p>Service workers are great because they let us implement functionalities we traditionally
never had on the web (think of <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/push-notifications/">push notifications</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/">add to homescreen</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync">background sync</a>
and the likes) but, for stuff that&rsquo;s been there, I
would advise to stick to the basics.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at an example code from a service worker that implements its own
caching &mdash; as you see not most straightforward code you&rsquo;ll bump
into:</p>

<p>As Jake Archibald, developer advocate at Google,
puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can hack around poor caching in your service worker, but you&#8217;re way better off fixing the root of the problem. Getting your [HTTP] caching right makes things easier in service worker land, but also benefits browsers that don&#8217;t support service worker (Safari, IE/Edge), and lets you get the most out of your CDN.</p><footer><strong>Jake Archibald</strong> <cite><a href='https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/'>Caching Best Practices</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Ditto.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Caching in HTTP has been here for almost 2 decades, it&rsquo;s a battle-tested
part of the protocol and allows you to efficiently trade freshness with scale
(emphasis on <em>efficiently</em>): there&rsquo;s no reason to implement our own application-level
caches when the protocol we use to exchange messages allows you to do the same,
for free, by just jamming a bunch of headers in your responses.</p>

<p>HTTP caching is truly the hidden gem of the protocol, and I wish more people would
be aware of the inner workings of the spec &mdash; to me it is a great example of
achieving great results without compromising on complexity, and this is the kind
of design we should aim towards when building software.</p>

<p>In short: <em>the HTTP cache is great. Be like the HTTP cache</em>.</p>
