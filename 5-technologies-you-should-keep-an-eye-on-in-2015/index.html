<div class="entry-content "><p>It&rsquo;s been a very short while since we landed
in 2015, but the technology scene is already
taking shape: here I&rsquo;d like to point at some
of the technologies that you should definitely
keep an eye on this year.</p>

<h2>React native</h2>

<p>Right out of <a href="http://jlongster.com/First-Impressions-using-React-Native">an article</a> describing the experience
using react native:</p>

<blockquote><p>It only takes a few minutes playing with React Native to realize the potential it has. This works.</p><p>It feels like I&#8217;m developing for the web. But I&#8217;m writing a real native app, and you seriously can&#8217;t tell the difference.</p><p>At the UI level, there is no difference; these are all native UIViews beautifully sliding around like normal.</p><p>This is solid engineering. And it completely reinforces the fact that React.js is the right way to build apps.<br/>I can write a native app using the same techniques as I would write web app.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start treating the DOM as an implementation detail, just like UIViews.</p></blockquote>


<p>For those of you who have missed the news, Facebook
is planning to completely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4">open source it&rsquo;s react native</a>
framework which is a layer to build native apps (on ios only, for now)
with good old DOM and a layer of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Not that similar tools do not exist as of now (among them
<a href="http://ionicframework.com/">ionic</a> seems to be very popular,
as it&rsquo;s built over <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">cordova</a> and angular)
but the real deal is that it seems that react native
<strong>feels really native</strong>: the limitation of hybrid solutions
has always been the fact that the UI turns quite sluggish
and doesn&rsquo;t feel very smooth, which is why react native
is kind of uber-exciting.</p>

<h2>Docker&rsquo;s ecosystem</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/docker.png"></p>

<p>During the DockerCon in Amsterdam, at the end of last year,
the docker guys announced that <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2014/12/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">a bunch of new tools</a> were
coming along to support <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/02/orchestrating-docker-with-machine-swarm-and-compose/">better orchestration</a>.</p>

<p>In these days those tools have seen their first
decent beta and stable releases:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/02/scaling-docker-with-swarm/">swarm</a>, a tool for clustering / scaling containers</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/02/announcing-docker-compose/">compose</a>, a way to orchestrate those clusters</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/02/announcing-docker-machine-beta/">machine</a>, the easiest way to get started with your first container</li>
</ul>


<p>As someone stated durint the european docker event:</p>

<blockquote><p>Docker was on no one&rsquo;s agenda in 2014, it&rsquo;s on everyone&rsquo;s agenda in 2015</p></blockquote>

<p>Can&rsquo;t use better words than those to describe how docker
is changing the way we want apps to be running.</p>

<p>Now, with the advent of these new tools that should provide
a better experience in terms of getting started / orchestration
things are just going to be more interesting.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>For better or for worse, JavaScript has taken the programming
ecosystem by storm over the past 5 years: it used to be just a
tool to make nicer interfaces whereas now hordes of programmers
are writing business logic with it<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
thanks to NodeJS and modern client-side frameworks like
AngularJS or Ember.</p>

<p>Truth is, JavaScript opens the door for <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/">isomorphic apps</a>
which is something developers are quite keen on (the ability
of running the &ldquo;same&rdquo; app / code both on the browser and the
server): the idea sounds quite crazy but it might become
more than a <em>weirdo</em> as we get more robust and solid solutions
to implement isomorphism.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/isomorphic-trend.png"></p>

<p>In other words, <strong>JavaScript ain&rsquo;t done yet</strong>.</p>

<h2>Microservices</h2>

<p>Microservices, an <a href="/on-monoliths-service-oriented-architectures-and-microservices/">implementation of SOA</a>,
are gaining a lot of attention simply because
the tooling around them has become much more
powerful in recent years: you can provision
hardware in minutes thanks to platforms like AWS
and deploy images of your application <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/docker/">in seconds</a>
thanks to Docker.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2015/02/27/reflecting-on-microservices/">figure out when using microservices</a>,
and everyone quite agrees on the fact that to roll
this kind of architectures out your entire infrastructure
needs to be very mature and robust, but at the same time
a lot more organizations seem keen on giving them a shot,
as they provide great flexibility when compared to good
old monoliths.</p>

<p>I recently watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLEx5khR4g7PIIBNcNhHOMmOhzxcwI5joG">Martin Fowler&rsquo;s take on microservices</a>
and read the <a href="http://nginx.com/blog/microservices-at-netflix-architectural-best-practices/">best practices Netflix uses</a> in this kind
of architecture. I strongly recommend keeping an eye on the
topic as there will be more to come this year.</p>

<h2>Golang</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/golang.png"></p>

<p>Now, seriously, I have lost the count of how many
technologies are being built with <a href="http://golang.org/">Golang</a>
these days!</p>

<p>You want me to mention a few of them?</p>

<ul>
<li>docker</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta">vegeta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rancherio/os">rancher/os</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd">websocketd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes">kubernetes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul">consul</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The list can go on for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>What is clear is that it seems like we are witnesses
of a shift into 2 programming emispheres: on one side,
web development is being taken by storm by JavaScript;
on the other end, it looks like <strong>Golang is ruling the
DevOps side of things</strong>.</p>

<p>I am exploring Go these days mostly because I&rsquo;m seeing a
lot of people going crazy for it, and I can understand where
they come from: sometimes you need strong typing and the
feeling that distributing your packages will be a painless
experience, plus the performances are great and the built-in
stuff in the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/">standard library</a> is
quite awesome. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of some things of the language
(ie. not a big supporter of how error handling works<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>)
but, hey, who&rsquo;s perfect?</p>

<p>So, yeah, I like Go for some of the things it can do and I like
other tools for doing other stuff, which is, I think, the
essence of technology: <strong>pick the right tool for the right
job</strong>.</p>

<p>Nowadays DevOps is leaning towards Golang and that is why,
I believe, we will see an even bigger shift in 2015.</p>

<p>The next Varnish? Probably written in Go.</p>

<h2>To wrap up</h2>

<p>This list gets a clear bias because of the fact that
I mostly work with the web, thus most of the tools
are either web-related or come from a web-ish background,
this is why you won&rsquo;t read about wearables or those
kind of things here.</p>

<p>I think these 5 technologies are something that we should
be closely monitoring in 2015 as they indicate which path
big players, industry leaders and the open source community
are taking.</p>
