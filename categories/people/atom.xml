    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was wasting my time on a trip <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+Dubai+Mall+-+Financial+Center+Road,+Near+Souk+Al+Bahar+Bridge,+DownTown+Dubai+-+%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9+%D8%AF%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%91+-+United+Arab+Emirates%E2%80%AD/Dubai+Marina+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/@25.14228,55.1815421,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f68282fe3dbb1:0xc9a673f9ef407801!2m2!1d55.278896!2d25.197628!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6b5402c126e3:0xb9511e6655c46d7c!2m2!1d55.144075!2d25.08135">back home</a>
and finally got to create an OS repo I was
thinking of for the past &frac34; weeks: a brief list
of <a href="https://github.com/odino/interviews">questions I ask during interviews</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You will find the list split in conceptual
areas: there&rsquo;s some stuff related to <a href="https://github.com/odino/interviews#frontend">frontend</a>,
some <a href="https://github.com/odino/interviews#reasoning">purely logical</a> question, something related
to <a href="https://github.com/odino/interviews#personalities">history of programming</a> and so on. This will
definitely help me doing my next interview, and
you might as well take some inspiration for when
you don&rsquo;t really know what to ask.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to the list
simply <a href="https://github.com/odino/interviews/edit/master/README.md">send a PR</a> and I will be more than
happy to merge your suggestion!</p>

<h2>PS: the way I structure interviews</h2>

<p>As an addendum, I wanted to share the way I conduct
interviews (it would be nice to get a feedback on this,
if you don&rsquo;t mind): I usually spend 5/10 minutes describing
the company, the organization of the tech team and
what we are looking for, to then let the candidate
talk about himself for another 10 minutes.</p>

<p>After that, it&rsquo;s time for some of these questions
and, when I think I&rsquo;m done, I let the candidate ask
me anything, since I think it&rsquo;s important to have
clear ideas on both sides.</p>

<p>Suggestions are mostly welcome!</p>
