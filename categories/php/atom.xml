flew back to Italy to partecipate to the 2014 edition of the
<a href="http://2014.phpday.it/">PHPDay</a> in Verona, sharing our
experience building APIs.</p>

<p>It was really a great time, especially since I missed the
event in the past couple of years, so it was a blast to see
those good'old tech-friends again.</p>

<p>Our presentation, titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/dont-screw-it-up-how-to-build-durable-web-apis-phpday-2014-in-verona-ita">Don&rsquo;t screw it up: how to build durable
web APIs</a>&rdquo;, went <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/11310">pretty well</a>: have a look below and let me know
if you have any feedback!</p>

<p>For the first time ever, I have to admit it, I will be
presenting <strong>3 topics that have very different backgrounds</strong>,
and, as the days go by, I realize that working at <a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi</a>
has been terrific under this point of view: we have the ability of
experimenting with different technologies and use the best out on the
market, something that gets translated into the ability of having a
360Â° overview of the market.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/montreal.jpg"></p>

<p>For me it will be the first time in the cold lands of Canada, and
I can&rsquo;t wait to make the most out of this trip: I always had a <strong>very</strong>
good opinion about canadians in general, hope this trip will
confirm my random thoughts.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to join, don&rsquo;t miss this amazing event:
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/2014/sessions">the schedule</a> speaks for itself
and I am thrilled to be part of such an amazing speakers' lineup
&mdash; which I obviously ruin :&ndash;) !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late november I will be for a few days in Paris,
attending and speaking at the 2013 edition of the
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php">Forum PHP Paris</a>:
funny enough, I&rsquo;ve only been to Paris for conferences so far,
as my <em>first-timer</em> there was during the
<a href="/symfony-live-2011-my-pov/">2011 edition of the Symfony Live</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/paris.jpg"></p>

<p>Topic of my talk will be what we&rsquo;ve witnessed
at <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#894">Namshi building our team and stack</a>:
from recruiting talents to automated testing, from
SOA&rsquo;s rules to deciding to use cutting-edge technologies
like <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>: don&rsquo;t miss the
opportunity to
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/inscription.php">reserve your seat for the event</a>,
since there will be amazing speakers, like
Igor Wiedler talking about <a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#967">Stack</a>,
PHP&rsquo;s rack, and
Dustin Whittle who will give his insights about
<a href="http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2013/sessions.php#964">scaling PHP apps</a>.</p>

<p>See you in the core of europe!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of August I will
be travelling to reach SF and
the <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest</a>, the annual
conference about
<a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Funny thing is, I have two talks
and none of them deals with Cake, <strong>at all</strong> :)</p>

<p>I will be talking about the
evolution of Web Protocols, in
particular HTTP/2.0 and SPDY, in a
remake of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/http-colon-slash-slash-the-end-of-the-road">talk I gave the IPC</a>,
in Mainz, last year.</p>

<p>My second talk will be a <em>new entry</em>, a
collection of tips, advices and tricks
in order to manage a SOA, learnt <strong>the hard
way</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are going to be around San Francisco
in the first days of Semptember, feel free to
ping me!</p>
