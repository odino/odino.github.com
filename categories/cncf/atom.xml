<p>This goes right into the list of <a href="/book-review-nodejs-high-performance/">books I really wanted to like</a> but kind of
disappointed me.</p>

<p>The book is structured extremely well, so it comes out as a very enjoyable read.
One downside, though, becomes fairly evident a few chapters in:
it isn&rsquo;t practical at all, describes few patterns and instead focuses a lot
on processes, advices and high-level description of approaches you should follow
to embrace CN infrastructure.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I was probably expecting too much, but when I read the book&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309">description on the
Kindle store</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>This <strong>practical</strong> guide shows you how to design and maintain infrastructure capable of managing the full lifecycle of these implementations.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got fairly excited and proceeded to buy.</p>

<p>Again, as I mentioned the book is really nice to read &mdash; I devoured it during my
daily commute to work, and that&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t expect from most technical books.
When it comes to content, though, I found it a tad repetitive and without many
real-world examples / lessons, so it felt more of an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; book around
the Cloud Native ecosystem than anything else.</p>

<p>I would have definitely appreciated
if the last chapter, which serves as an introduction to interesting patterns
such as circuit breaking, would have gone more into details: it might have been
out of the scope of the book but would have definitely made it feel more &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Cloud Native infrastructure goes down as an introductory
guide to the CN world. Iâ€™d recommend you to read it if you just started
approaching the ecosystem.</p>
