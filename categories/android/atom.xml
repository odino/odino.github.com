    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/android.jpg"></p>

<p>In my <a href="/contributing-to-react-native-for-android/">last post</a> I explained how
you can hack on react native for android locally, so that if you need any
change to the java packages<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> you can do it yourself, with
immediate feedback upon a <code>react-native run-android</code>.</p>

<p>One thing I immediately patched was the ability to
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews">enable remote debugging on webviews</a>,
which is turned off in react native &mdash; and here&rsquo;s
how you can do the same.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you look at the <code>ReactWebViewManager.java</code> you immediately notice that
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/views/webview/ReactWebViewManager.java#L79-L80">debugging is commented</a>: this is because
it needs to be enabled on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3652560/what-is-the-android-uithread-ui-thread">UI thread</a>, else android is funny enough to <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/webview/+/3e9cdbe3fe00ef50eff256e7b5f4b6a1ae796ec5/chromium/java/com/android/webview/chromium/WebViewChromiumFactoryProvider.java#343">crash the application through a RuntimeException</a>.
Putting it in a static initializer makes it run on any thread that requires
this class, which is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/4857">why is disabled</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time, you can just move it around to have it enabled in your dev environment;
just place the line that enables debugging in the <code>onPageStarted</code> method:</p>

<p>```java
@Override
public void onPageStarted(WebView webView, String url, Bitmap favicon) {
  super.onPageStarted(webView, url, favicon);
  mLastLoadFailed = false;</p>

<p>  ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext) ((ReactWebView) webView).getContext();</p>

<p>  WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);</p>

<p>  &hellip;
```</p>

<p>and, after re-running <code>react native run-android</code>, you should be good to go:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/webview-remote-debugging.png"></p>

<p>Other stuff like live screencasting work as expected:</p>

    <link href="https://odino.org/contributing-to-react-native-for-android/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-01T11:19:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://odino.org/contributing-to-react-native-for-android</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/reactjs.png"></p>

<p>It is no news that we, at <a href="http://tech.namshi.com">Namshi</a>, like to play around with all
sorts of interesting technologies: last but not least, we&rsquo;re
taking a closer look at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">react native</a>, the framework from Facebook
that allows you to build mobile, native apps with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React components</a>.</p>

<p>While developing a small prototype, we had a small issue with
a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">WebView</a> that was supposed to run within our application and
wanted to enable <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews">remote debugging on chrome</a>
to troubleshoot it: since this is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/e4272b456e6948c0942c610d3bc65bc29f0a7be6/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/views/webview/ReactWebViewManager.java#L77-L82">turned
off by default</a>, we had to recompile react native with webview
debugging enabled, and I wanted to share my brief experience with
it since, with the same approach, you can start hacking and
contributing to react native itself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The guys have created a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-building-from-source.html#content">small guide on how to compile RN from source</a>,
which can be summarized in just a couple steps: first, add the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">android NDK</a> to
your environment and then configure the build system to build from source and
not from the <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.facebook.react/react-native">pre-built react-native packages</a>.</p>

<h2>Download and configure the Android NDK</h2>

<p>Download the latest version of the NDK, make it executable
and run it: the package extracts itself in the current folder
and then you only need to set an environment variable
pointing to the NDK, so that the android build system will
be able to locate the NDK:</p>

<p><code>
cd /somewhere
wget http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10e-linux-x86_64.bin
chmod a+x android-ndk-r10e-linux-x86_64.bin
./android-ndk-r10e-linux-x86_64.bin
export ANDROID_NDK=/somewhere/android-ndk-r10e
</code></p>

<h2>Configure RN to build from source</h2>

<p>This involves a few manual steps, but should be pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>In your react project, open <code>android/app/build.gradle</code>, you should see a
<code>dependencies</code> section like the following:</p>

<p>```
dependencies {</p>

<pre><code>compile fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1"

compile "com.facebook.react:react-native:0.17.+"
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>See, <code>compile "com.facebook.react:react-native:0.17.+"</code> tells the build system
to get the pre-built packages, released by facebook, rather that building react-native
from your local sources.</p>

<p>Now, change that line to:</p>

<p><code>
compile project(':ReactAndroid')
</code></p>

<p>then open <code>android/settings.gradle</code> and tell the build system how to locate
the new project that will be compiled; add, at the bottom of the file:</p>

<p>```
include &lsquo;:ReactAndroid&rsquo;</p>

<p>project(&lsquo;:ReactAndroid&rsquo;).projectDir = new File(</p>

<pre><code>rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native/ReactAndroid')
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Last but not least, you will need 1 change in <code>android/build.gradle</code>, in the
<code>dependencies</code> section:</p>

<p><code>
classpath 'de.undercouch:gradle-download-task:2.0.0'
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<h2>At the end</h2>

<p>Now, when you run <code>react-native run-android</code>, you should notice that the
build is slightly slower, due to the fact that <a href="http://gradle.org/">gradle</a>
is trying to compile RN from source rather than from the pre-built packages.</p>

<p>You can then open <code>./node_modules/react-native/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/</code>
and start hacking around, making your own changes and testing them with a simple
<code>react-native run-android</code>.</p>

<p>For us, we were eventually able to enable remote debugging on webviews and found out
why our webview wasn&rsquo;t running: it simply needed access to the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>,
which is turned off by default on android webviews<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past 5 years, mobile devices have taken
the world by storm, creating new opportunities
for both consumers and vendors: truth is, the
landscape of mobile <strong>development</strong> still looks
very immature and we should be prepared to see a
radical change in the next 2 to 5 years.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>A suboptimal development industry</h2>

<p>As we all agree, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">duplication is something bad</a>
in software engineering: it leads to unmaintainable,
error-prone code that requires a signicant effort
to be fixed.</p>

<p>If you are a mobile factory or a product-company
with its own apps-development team, you might be
familiar with the annoying problem of fixing, or
implementing, the same thing twice.</p>

<p>Nowadays, unfortunately, <strong>duplicate efforts are the norm
while developing mobile apps</strong>: you have to reproduce
the same behaviour across different platforms (ios
and android, but add blackberry or windows phone if you&rsquo;re
not that lucky) which led people to create tools like
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org">cordova</a>.</p>

<p>Problem is, these tools ain&rsquo;t the solution: they don&rsquo;t work
as nicely as native apps, they probably hide too
much from the developer and vendors aren&rsquo;t keen
on supporting them that much. If you, like me,
gave stuff like <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">ionic</a> a try,
you probably first found yourself surprised by
how nice your demo app would look and behave,
to then just find out that <strong>the more you were
implementing, the quirkier it looked</strong>.</p>

<p>On another note, the decision on how to structure
the team isn&rsquo;t trivial as well: shall
I get devs who can hack on both
platforms? Let&rsquo;s create 2 separate teams? Shall I
get 2 lead developers or 1 guy that has a good
sense on how both platforms work?</p>

<p>We need things to be better: just like the web,
mobile is now a scary land of vendors-dictated
&ldquo;standards&rdquo;. <strong>We don&rsquo;t need another JavaScript.</strong></p>

<h2>The need for standards</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think mobile is much different to what
JavaScript used to look like until 3/5 years ago:
a lot of vendor-specific standards, weird tools
that try to uniform these platforms and a plethora
of things that just don&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We need uniform APIs, we need to be able to rely
on the same toolchain (for example, official <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=en">staged rollouts</a> on the Apple Store)
and we need the same kind of transition the JS
ecosystem has seen: vendors need to
come together and design all of these things
altogether, agree on a minimal interface to share
and get ready to kill the mess.</p>

<p>Of course, there are a bit more complications here,
as we are talking about very different platforms,
with different development tools and workflow, which
is why I think we will see huge changes, from this
point of view, in the next 3 years.</p>

<h2>How will it look like?</h2>

<p>I have been telling people for a while that I do not
believe this multi-platform, fragmented ecosystem
can last for long, as I think it will eventually
lead vendors to agree on a common platform to work on.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it needs to be Objective-C,
but it definitely <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/27mu3v/why_do_android_dev_tools_still_suck/">won&rsquo;t be Android on Java</a>.
At the same time, I don&rsquo;t know how interested Apple
would be in making Swift / Objective-C a thing for the
masses (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7133728/objective-c-in-linux">the masses are interested though</a>).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, thinking of <strong>one, unified mobile
platform</strong> seems kind of crazy today but, in 5 years,
devs would look back and wonder &ldquo;how could we do it like
that, to be wasting efforts on so many different platforms?&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>My personal feeling?</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, all we need is to give a popular
language a simple API to be able to completely access
your device.</p>

<p>That language&rsquo;s name is probably JavaScript<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.
And that API is probably something like <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore">JavaScriptCore</a>.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.railslove.com/stories/fresh-on-our-radar-react-native">React Native</a>
seems to be already halfway through the journey of
making all of this real, my feeling is that it won&rsquo;t
take long until vendors will realize that the
easiest thing to do is to <strong>give JavaScript a (real) shot</strong>.</p>

<p>KTHXBYE.</p>

    <link href="https://odino.org/frontend-web-development-is-not-as-fun-as-it-should-be/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-10T19:53:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://odino.org/frontend-web-development-is-not-as-fun-as-it-should-be</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am writing this post in the middle of revamping
<a href="http://en-ae.namshi.com">Namshi&rsquo;s architecture</a>
with AngularJS, reverse proxies,
SPDY and HTTP APIs, because I
strongly believe in the future of these technologies and
that they are the de-facto cutting-edge solution for
most of the antipatterns that we&rsquo;ve seen so far:
monolithic applications, unscalable frontends,
limited protocols.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/browsers.jpg"></p>

<p>So why would I rant about it? Well, this is not a real
rant but it&rsquo;s more of a retrospective on the <em>gotchas</em>
that we faced over the past months: I do <strong>really</strong>
enjoy all of this techs, but also
recognize that most of them are at a
very early stage and have their pitfalls when it comes
to develop real-world, scalable architectures.</p>

<p>The boring part&rsquo;s over, let&rsquo;s get into the real mess ;&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Reducing redirects?</h2>

<p>Suppose that you have a frontend, maybe built with AngularJS,
that proxies all the requests to an API, so if you request
<code>example.org/about</code>, your frontend actually gets the content
from <code>api.example.org/about</code>.</p>

<p>One of the things that you can start optimizing are the
round trips between the client and the server (very important
for mobile connections): for example,
instead of sending simple redirects from your API to the
frontend, you can return a <code>30X</code> and include the actual body
in the response; in this way, the client can:</p>

<ul>
<li>read the body of the response and work with it (output or whatever)</li>
<li>update the browser URL according to the <code>Location</code> header provided in the response with the <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html">browsers' history API</a></li>
</ul>


<p>NOT. SO. FAST.</p>

<p>Turns out that modern browsers intercept redirects and make an
additional HTTP request to the <code>Location</code> provided by the response.</p>

<p>This behavior is pretty useful in 98% of your use-cases, as
you dont have to take care of handling AJAX redirects on
your own and you have a pretty simple solution, using a
custom HTTP status
code, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call">278</a>, for the remaining 2% of scenarios.</p>

<p>NOT. SO. FAST. 2.</p>

<p>Of course, the magnificent <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/the-number-one-mobile-web-browser-googles-native-android-browser/2091">Android native browser</a>
will mess this up, thinking that <code>278</code> is an error code: so if, for
your HTTP request, you have a callback in case of success and
one in case of an error, the latter will be triggered.</p>

<p>How to deal with this?</p>

<p>Well, we decided to return straight <code>200 Ok</code> codes and include
2 custom headers, <code>X-Location</code> and <code>X-Status-Code</code>, that our
clients will parse to find out if they need to update the
browser&rsquo;s URL.</p>

<p>In pseudo-code:</p>

<p>```
res = http.get(&lsquo;api.example.org?search=BMW&rsquo;)</p>

<p>if (res.status_code === 200 &amp;&amp; res.headers.x-location) {</p>

<pre><code>browser.url = res.headers.x-location
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>In any case, with the growing amount of mobile clients, I think
it might make sense to start thinking of an appropriate process
to handle redirects, within the HTTP protocol, so that browsers
can just follow the spec: in my opinion we could use something
like <code>308 Transparent redirect</code> for this.</p>

<h2>Reverse proxies and HTTP cache</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/varnish-cache.jpg"></p>

<p>Two of the most <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/12/12/stale">important directives</a>
that you can use while taking advantage of the HTTP cache
are <code>stale-while-revalidate</code> and <code>stale-if-error</code>:
the former lets you return stale responses
while you revalidate the cache while the latter lets you serve
cached responses if your backend is down (<code>50X</code> errors).</p>

<p>Of course, you will need a reverse proxy in front
of your webserver in order to really take advantage of
these directives: <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a> natively implements
both of them but, in our case, it was too much of a hassle to setup,
as it&rsquo;s bloated compared to its cousin <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>,
which doesn&rsquo;t natively implement <code>stale-*</code> directives instead.</p>

<p>Setting up Varnish to support those 2 directives it&rsquo;s a matter
of a few tries anyhow, as you can mimic the (almost) same
behaviors with Varnish&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.varnish-software.com/static/book/Saving_a_request.html#core-grace-mechanisms">grace and saint modes</a>.</p>

<h2>Android&rsquo;s native browser</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/android.jpg"></p>

<p>Android, oh Android!</p>

<p>As we already saw, its native browser doesn&rsquo;t let you play around
with unconventional HTTP status codes<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> and, on top of that,
<strong>it breaks the HTTP cache</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have a cacheable resource that you retrieve via AJAX,
the first request to retrieve will work, but as soon as you reload
the page and retrieve it a second time, the browser messes things up,
things that the request returned an invalid HTTP status code (<code>0</code>)
and aborts the process.</p>

<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://opensourcehacker.com/2011/03/20/android-webkit-xhr-status-code-0-and-expires-headers/">known bug</a>.</p>

<h2>Performances on old devices</h2>

<p>And when I say old I mean stuff like the Galaxy S2 or S3, which are not <strong>that</strong> old
to be honest.</p>

<p>Performances are anyhow a huge concern when you start moving the logic into
the clients, as resources might be very limited: let&rsquo;s not forget that the
first generation of Galaxy &ndash; or even the iPhone 4 &ndash; were shipped out with
just 512mb of RAM; think of a JS-heavy app, which sucks up to 40/50mb of RAM:
how would that perform on those devices?</p>

<p>Let me tell you that: it&rsquo;d be very slow, and would even feel slower when CPUs
comes into the mix as &ndash; we&rsquo;ve witnessed it &ndash; to build DOM elements<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>
it could take up to 4s. Of course, you can optimize it, but a brand new smartphone
wouldn&rsquo;t let you feel such <em>lag</em>: truth is that when you decide to go for a JS app
you need to take into account the time spent in optimizations for old devices,
as you&rsquo;ll surely need to invest on it.</p>

<h2>What a hard time debugging browser events</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/chrome-devtools.png"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever dug deep into optimizing browser events (HTML parsing, repainting and so on)
you probably know what I&rsquo;m talking about: the devtools are still at an early stage and
it becomes really tricky to be able to nail issues down or at least to efficiently
reverse engineer them; even though you have a breakdown of every browser event it&rsquo;s
actually pretty difficult to trace events back to their &ldquo;cause&rdquo;<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Chrome provides profiles and the timeline which are very useful resources, but you can&rsquo;t
really inspect that much as at a certain point you&rsquo;ll end up with <strong>a lot</strong> of events
like <em>HTML parsing</em> or <em>Function call</em> and only God knows where they exactly came from.</p>

<h2>Persistent sessions and credentials</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/security.jpg"></p>

<p>Authenticating users might be tricky for frontend apps: you don&rsquo;t have the good old
(and heavy) PHP sessions that you can just fill up on you server, but you &ndash; at least
initially &ndash; can try to persist sessions on cookies or <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html">localStorage</a>.</p>

<p>But even before thinking of storing sessions you have to deal with authenticating each
of your user from the app: granted that the HTTP basic auth is not good as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Security">it&rsquo;s flawed</a> and that
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">digest auth</a> might be too simple,
you should start looking at alternative methods to authenticate and authorize your users,
preferrably using tokens.</p>

<p>As you probably figured out, there is no real standard mechanism of doing this, as some
providers rely on oAuth (both 2-* and 3-legged) and some on OpenID. Even Mozilla, a while ago,
came out with its own protocol, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Persona</a>, to solve this
problem.</p>

<p>We actually found out another &ldquo;protocol&rdquo; to store and transmit credentials through HTTP
APIs, the <em>Javascript Object Signing and Encryption</em> specification (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/">JOSE</a>).</p>

<h2>A note on AngularJS and the Grunt ecosystem</h2>

<p>A glimpse of our <code>package.json</code>:</p>

<p>``` json
{
  &ldquo;devDependencies&rdquo;: {</p>

<pre><code>"grunt": "~0.4.1",
"grunt-contrib-copy": "~0.4.1",
"grunt-contrib-concat": "~0.3.0",
"grunt-contrib-coffee": "~0.7.0",
"grunt-contrib-uglify": "~0.2.0",
"grunt-contrib-compass": "~0.3.0",
"grunt-contrib-jshint": "~0.6.0",
"grunt-contrib-cssmin": "~0.6.0",
"grunt-contrib-connect": "~0.4.0",
"grunt-contrib-clean": "~0.4.1",
"grunt-contrib-htmlmin": "~0.1.3",
"grunt-contrib-imagemin": "~0.1.4",
"grunt-contrib-watch": "~0.5.3",
"grunt-usemin": "~0.1.11",
"grunt-rev": "~0.1.0",
"grunt-karma": "~0.4.3",
"grunt-open": "~0.2.0",
"matchdep": "~0.1.2",
...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you see, the bower/node/grunt/angular ecosystem is still very young and,
from certain points of view, very immature (for example, <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect/issues/9">SSL support in Grunt</a>
was added just 2 months ago).</p>

<p>So if you want to use these kind of technologies you must accept that, sometimes,
doing an <code>npm install</code> might break something, or that you will need to keep your deps
updated to the latest releases: it&rsquo;s all about <strong>go big or go home</strong>.</p>

<h2>Internet Explorer. As always.</h2>

<p>Eheh, there could not be a post about <em>web gotchas</em> without mentioning IE:
the lack of support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a>
in IE8 and IE9 is actually a real kicker for
efficiently implementing frontend apps that rely on a remote API
(<code>example.org</code> &ndash;> <code>api.example.org</code>), since CORS considers as cross-domain
even a request on a subdomain<sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And no, there is no native escape strategy for this: you <strong>must</strong> extend the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XHR</a> in order to make it capable of doing
cross-domain communication through Iframes, a strategy that even Google and Facebook
have implemented in the past; luckily there is some stuff already written for us,
so we can use the good <a href="https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain">xDomain</a> and
include it with the IE conditional comments.</p>

<p>But then, you would think, why not using xDomain for everything, and simply drop
CORS?</p>

<p>Well, there are a few things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>even though Google and Facebook are known to be using some trick like xDomain, it&rsquo;s
pretty strange that they havent released anything yet (might be that they don&rsquo;t consider
it a long-term option)</li>
<li>the native Android browser was known to have <a href="https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain/issues/19">issues with this library</a></li>
<li>CORS is a growing standard that has been widely adopted by the community</li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain/blob/gh-pages/dist/xdomain.js">code</a> looks kind of cryptic</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, we didnt feel like using xDomain for everything, as we are just using
it for IE8/9<sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup>: <a href="https://github.com/jpillora">Jaime</a> did a great job
implementing it but I personally feel that it might be <strong>too much</strong> to just blindly
rely on it for cross-domain communications.</p>

<h2>CORS and HTTP headers</h2>

<p>Deciding to go with CORS it&rsquo;s just half of it, as the other half consists
into actually implementing CORS on both your clients and servers (APIs): it&rsquo;s
worth mentioning that the specification is really strict when it comes to
<strong>send and manipulate custom HTTP headers</strong> (like the <code>X-Location</code> that we
saw at the beginning of this post).</p>

<p>If you wanna send a custom header you will need to specify it in the
<code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> header:</p>

<p><code>
Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-My-Custom-Header
</code></p>

<p>and if you want your clients to be able to access some of the response&rsquo;s headers you will
need to declare them as &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;:</p>

<p><code>
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-My-Other-Header, X-...
</code></p>

<h2>How to do RUM?</h2>

<p>Another good question (and I don&rsquo;t have an answer so far) is how to measure
performances as felt by the end-user (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring">Real User Monitoring</a>),
since AngularJS loads once and then never triggers server-side measurable events
other than HTTP requests to your APIs: the API&rsquo;s response times cannot be taken
into account as you wouldn&rsquo;t measure the
performance perceived by the end user &ndash; remember, JS frameworks add HTML parsing,
data-binding and so on on top of the cake.</p>

<p>We still have to figure out how we will implement RUM in our apps,
if you have any suggestion it would be highly appreciated!</p>

<h2>All in all&hellip;</h2>

<p>Developing on the frontend is an amazing experience that has some drawbacks, like on
any platform: beware of the specs (like CORS) and gotchas (IE, Android&rsquo;s native browser) and you will
enjoy it to the max!</p>
