    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to get <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team">our backend team</a> to familiarize with React, I ran a quick intro
to the library, based on &ldquo;evolving&rdquo; a JSFiddle from a single, static component
to adding UI interactions, using props / state and so on. Nothing groundbreaking
but something that covers the most important bits of React.</p>

<p>I summarized my intro in a repo called &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/odino/react-in-1000-words">React in 1000 words</a>&rdquo;
and wanted to share it here as well, in case anyone finds it useful.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The goal of the guide is to get people who haven&rsquo;t worked with React before
familiar with the most important concepts, and illustrate how easy it is to
compose interfaces based on loosely-coupled React components. Feel free to send
a PR, but let&rsquo;s keep the word count low! :)</p>
