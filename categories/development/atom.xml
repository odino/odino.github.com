    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I bumped into <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a>, a tool written by <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile">Filippo</a>,
the same guy behind the popular <a href="https://filippo.io/Heartbleed/">heartbleed test tool</a>.</p>

<p>The tool in question answers one simple need:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/mkcert-ko.png"></p>

<p>By creating a local root CA file that gets installed in your system, making all
certificates issued by <code>mkcert</code> trusted:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/mkcert-ok.png"></p>

<p>After downloading the latest release from Github you can simply &ldquo;install&rdquo; it
by running <code>mkcert -install</code>. Once that is done, you can create your first,
trusted (by your own system) certificate:</p>

<p>```
$ mkcert somedomain.local</p>

<p>Using the local CA at &ldquo;/home/alex/.local/share/mkcert&rdquo; âœ¨</p>

<p>Created a new certificate valid for the following names ðŸ“œ
 &ndash; &ldquo;somedomain.local&rdquo;</p>

<p>The certificate is at &ldquo;./somedomain.local.pem&rdquo; and the key at &ldquo;./somedomain.local-key.pem&rdquo; âœ…
```</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s how it would look like if you had to boot a node server with
SSL support:</p>

<p>``` js
const fs = require(&lsquo;fs&rsquo;)</p>

<p>const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(<strong>dirname + &lsquo;/somedomain.local-key.pem&rsquo;),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(</strong>dirname + &lsquo;/somedomain.local.pem&rsquo;)
};</p>

<p>require(&lsquo;https&rsquo;).createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200)
  res.end(<code>Got SSL?</code>)
}).listen(443)
```</p>

<p>Pretty neat, ah? What <code>mkcert</code> does is to simply add another CA file
in your system (I guess under <code>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</code>, but I&rsquo;m not
entirely sure) so that browsers consider these certificates trusted &mdash; a nice
workaround to trick any HTTP client.</p>

<p>Adios!</p>

    <link href="https://odino.org/local-development-with-rkt-containers/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-15T23:21:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://odino.org/local-development-with-rkt-containers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/rkt.png"></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I stumbled upon an interesting <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14176191">hackernews discussion</a>
about setting up development environments: from what I could tell it seemed like
most people have been ditching Vagrant and VMs in order to move towards
docker containers, through <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">minikube</a>.</p>

<p>Compose, to be fair, provides a painless user experience and allows you to extend
your Dockerfiles to be able to run containers with specific &ldquo;dev&rdquo; settings, like
local volumes and different commands (think <code>node index.js</code> vs <code>nodemon index.js</code>).</p>

<p>What if we could have a similar experience with <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/">rkt</a>?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>All in all, what you need to run docker containers locally are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a bunch of binaries (<code>docker</code> / <code>docker-compose</code>)</li>
<li>a file to build your production image (<code>Dockerfile</code>)</li>
<li>a file to extend that image with some dev settings (<code>docker-compose.yml</code>)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I wanted to play with rkt and I couldn&rsquo;t find an easy way to maintain the
same workflow I had using docker, I decided to build a small tool called <a href="https://github.com/odino/rkd">rkd</a>
(<em>rkt dev</em>) that can help you achieve the same exact productivity you&rsquo;d have
using docker and docker-compose. This is an early-stage experiment<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> and, as such,
things might break here &amp; there.</p>

<p>Let me recap it: like we&rsquo;d do with docker, we&rsquo;ll first need to <strong>download a bunch
of binaries</strong>, then <strong>create a file that describes our production container</strong> and, last
but not least, <strong>define our dev settings</strong> in another file.</p>

<p>If the whole thing takes longer than 5 minutes we fail, so let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>

<h2>Step 0: our sample NodeJS app</h2>

<p>Create a brand new folder in your fs (<code>path/to/my/app</code>), a subfolder <code>src</code> and
place an <code>index.js</code> there:</p>

<p>``` js path/to/my/app/src/index.js
require(&lsquo;http&rsquo;).createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.end(&lsquo;Hello world!&rsquo;)
  console.log(&lsquo;Request received&hellip;&rsquo;)
}).listen(8080)</p>

<p>console.log(&lsquo;server started&hellip;&rsquo;)
```</p>

<p>No rocket science.</p>

<h2>Step 1: binaries</h2>

<p>We will need to download binaries for our platform of 3 tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rkt/rkt/releases">rkt</a>, the container engine</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/containers/build/releases">acbuild</a>, the tool that&rsquo;s used to build <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/app-container.html#aci">ACIs</a>, which are containers images that rkt can run</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/odino/rkd/releases">rkd</a>, a tool I&rsquo;ve built to be able to automate building &amp; running rkt containers</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve grabbed the binaries you can test them by running <code>rkt</code>, <code>acbuild</code> &amp;
<code>rkd</code>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: writing a &ldquo;Dockerfile&rdquo;</h2>

<p>In order to build ACIs we would need to run a bunch of shell commands such as:</p>

<p><code>bash
acbuild begin
acbuild set-name example.com/hello
acbuild dep add quay.io/coreos/alpine-sh
run -- apk add --update nodejs
...
...
...
acbuild end
</code></p>

<p>but that&rsquo;s a hella lot of commands and being repetitive is no fun at all &mdash; we
can automate this task with <code>rkd</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a <code>prod.rkd</code> file:</p>

<p><code>bash path/to/my/app/prod.rkd
set-name example.com/node-hello
dep add quay.io/coreos/alpine-sh
run -- apk add --update nodejs
copy src /src
set-working-directory /src
set-exec -- node index.js
port add www tcp 8080
</code></p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re describing how our &ldquo;production&rdquo; container should look like, similarly
to what we&rsquo;d do with a Dockerfile:</p>

<p><code>bash Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/coreos/alpine-sh
RUN apk add --update nodejs
COPY src /src
WORKDIR /src
CMD node index.js
EXPOSE 8080
</code></p>

<p>As you see, the syntax is extremely similar, you just need to familiarize with
<code>acbuild</code>&rsquo;s commands.</p>

<p>After writing our <code>prod.rkd</code> we are ready to extend it with our own development
settings.</p>

<h2>Step 3: writing a &ldquo;docker-compose.yml&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Our <code>docker-compose.yml</code> will instead be named <code>dev.rkd</code>, and we just need a
couple instruction in it to mount our local code and change the executable that
is used to run the container:</p>

<p><code>bash path/to/my/app/dev.rkd
run -- npm install -g nodemon
mount add . src
set-exec -- nodemon index.js
</code></p>

<p>Nothing more, nothing less: we are now ready to rock!</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s run our app!</h2>

<p>In order to build the ACIs and run them in &ldquo;dev&rdquo; mode we simply need to type
<code>rkd up</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo rkd up

<p>Hell yeah.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this article and are excited about the progress made by rkt
in order to provide a viable alternative to docker. I wrote rkd in a few hours
and it really is just a wrapper around acbuild &amp; rkt, so kudos to those guys.</p>

<p>In my opinion, rkt is still quite behind docker but they&rsquo;re filling the gaps,
getting closer as the days go by &mdash; it won&rsquo;t be long until we&rsquo;ll be realistically
able to switch over without &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; the difference.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past 5 years, mobile devices have taken
the world by storm, creating new opportunities
for both consumers and vendors: truth is, the
landscape of mobile <strong>development</strong> still looks
very immature and we should be prepared to see a
radical change in the next 2 to 5 years.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>A suboptimal development industry</h2>

<p>As we all agree, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">duplication is something bad</a>
in software engineering: it leads to unmaintainable,
error-prone code that requires a signicant effort
to be fixed.</p>

<p>If you are a mobile factory or a product-company
with its own apps-development team, you might be
familiar with the annoying problem of fixing, or
implementing, the same thing twice.</p>

<p>Nowadays, unfortunately, <strong>duplicate efforts are the norm
while developing mobile apps</strong>: you have to reproduce
the same behaviour across different platforms (ios
and android, but add blackberry or windows phone if you&rsquo;re
not that lucky) which led people to create tools like
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org">cordova</a>.</p>

<p>Problem is, these tools ain&rsquo;t the solution: they don&rsquo;t work
as nicely as native apps, they probably hide too
much from the developer and vendors aren&rsquo;t keen
on supporting them that much. If you, like me,
gave stuff like <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">ionic</a> a try,
you probably first found yourself surprised by
how nice your demo app would look and behave,
to then just find out that <strong>the more you were
implementing, the quirkier it looked</strong>.</p>

<p>On another note, the decision on how to structure
the team isn&rsquo;t trivial as well: shall
I get devs who can hack on both
platforms? Let&rsquo;s create 2 separate teams? Shall I
get 2 lead developers or 1 guy that has a good
sense on how both platforms work?</p>

<p>We need things to be better: just like the web,
mobile is now a scary land of vendors-dictated
&ldquo;standards&rdquo;. <strong>We don&rsquo;t need another JavaScript.</strong></p>

<h2>The need for standards</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think mobile is much different to what
JavaScript used to look like until 3/5 years ago:
a lot of vendor-specific standards, weird tools
that try to uniform these platforms and a plethora
of things that just don&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We need uniform APIs, we need to be able to rely
on the same toolchain (for example, official <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=en">staged rollouts</a> on the Apple Store)
and we need the same kind of transition the JS
ecosystem has seen: vendors need to
come together and design all of these things
altogether, agree on a minimal interface to share
and get ready to kill the mess.</p>

<p>Of course, there are a bit more complications here,
as we are talking about very different platforms,
with different development tools and workflow, which
is why I think we will see huge changes, from this
point of view, in the next 3 years.</p>

<h2>How will it look like?</h2>

<p>I have been telling people for a while that I do not
believe this multi-platform, fragmented ecosystem
can last for long, as I think it will eventually
lead vendors to agree on a common platform to work on.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it needs to be Objective-C,
but it definitely <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/27mu3v/why_do_android_dev_tools_still_suck/">won&rsquo;t be Android on Java</a>.
At the same time, I don&rsquo;t know how interested Apple
would be in making Swift / Objective-C a thing for the
masses (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7133728/objective-c-in-linux">the masses are interested though</a>).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, thinking of <strong>one, unified mobile
platform</strong> seems kind of crazy today but, in 5 years,
devs would look back and wonder &ldquo;how could we do it like
that, to be wasting efforts on so many different platforms?&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>My personal feeling?</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, all we need is to give a popular
language a simple API to be able to completely access
your device.</p>

<p>That language&rsquo;s name is probably JavaScript<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.
And that API is probably something like <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore">JavaScriptCore</a>.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.railslove.com/stories/fresh-on-our-radar-react-native">React Native</a>
seems to be already halfway through the journey of
making all of this real, my feeling is that it won&rsquo;t
take long until vendors will realize that the
easiest thing to do is to <strong>give JavaScript a (real) shot</strong>.</p>

<p>KTHXBYE.</p>
