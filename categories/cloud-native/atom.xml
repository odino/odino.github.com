    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/cni-book.jpg"></p>

<p>This goes right into the list of <a href="/book-review-nodejs-high-performance/">books I really wanted to like</a> but kind of
disappointed me.</p>

<p>The book is structured extremely well, so it comes out as a very enjoyable read.
One downside, though, becomes fairly evident a few chapters in:
it isn&rsquo;t practical at all, describes few patterns and instead focuses a lot
on processes, advices and high-level description of approaches you should follow
to embrace CN infrastructure.</p>

<p>I was probably expecting too much, but when I read the book&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309">description on the
Kindle store</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>This <strong>practical</strong> guide shows you how to design and maintain infrastructure capable of managing the full lifecycle of these implementations.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got fairly excited and proceeded to buy.</p>

<p>Again, as I mentioned the book is really nice to read &mdash; I devoured it during my
daily commute to work, and that&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t expect from most technical books.
When it comes to content, though, I found it a tad repetitive and without many
real-world examples / lessons, so it felt more of an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; book around
the Cloud Native ecosystem than anything else.</p>

<p>I would have definitely appreciated
if the last chapter, which serves as an introduction to interesting patterns
such as circuit breaking, would have gone more into details: it might have been
out of the scope of the book but would have definitely made it feel more &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Cloud Native infrastructure goes down as an introductory
guide to the CN world. Iâ€™d recommend you to read it if you just started
approaching the ecosystem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t generally spend time blogging (or bragging) about technologies I don&rsquo;t
use in production, but today I wanted to make sure <a href="https://gist.github.com/odino/7ce4dc3bb77d6282b2f2aaf1050c29e3">Istio</a> gets a special mention on
this blog.</p>

<p>The original problem was: how do I package and run apps with ease? And Docker came.</p>

<p>Then it was a matter of how do we organize all of these containers. And Kubernetes came.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we now have to sort out how to make services communicate
to each other, how to route them conditionally and secure this layer of communication.
That&rsquo;s where Istio, a <a href="https://buoyant.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/">service mesh</a> for microservices developed <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/istio/">Google, IBM and Lyft</a>, kicks in.</p>

<p>Some of the cool things you can do with this service mesh?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://istio.io/docs/tasks/policy-enforcement/rate-limiting.html">rate limiting</a></li>
<li><a href="https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/handling-failures.html">circuit breakers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/rules-configuration.html#timeouts-and-retries">auto-retry API calls</a></li>
<li><a href="https://istio.io/blog/2017/0.1-canary.html">canary releases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.mixer.v1.config.client.html#JWT">JWT authn/authz</a></li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip;and much, much more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this talk by Kelsey Hightower &mdash; I&rsquo;m sure that, with time,
Istio will blow your mind:</p>
