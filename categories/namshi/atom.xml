    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I wave goodbye to the company I supported for the past 7 and
a half years, Namshi.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&rsquo;s with mixed feeling that I write this blog post, as it&rsquo;s been
a hell of a ride and I recognize I was privileged to get on board
just at the right time. It is a truly
bittersweet moment to leave behind something you&rsquo;ve dedicate so much
to, but I do feel <em>my time is now</em>: after all of these years I long for a change
of scenery, (somewhat) different challenges and new environment
to flourish in. It won&rsquo;t be easy to replicate what we&rsquo;ve done over
the past years, but the least I can do is to try to spread all the
good I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>

<p>To all my teammates, I thank you for striving to make this
happen: we wouldn&rsquo;t have come anywhere near to where we are right now
if it wasn&rsquo;t for the collective team effort we put over the years.
This is a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; that spans 7 years of life, so it goes to the
the current team as much as it goes to the ones who were there in
2012, when it was real wild. From the warehouse to HQ, your work
was impressive, and it&rsquo;s a great story in the region.</p>

<p>I want to take a moment to mention <a href="https://tech.namshi.io/team/">the folks
in the tech team</a>, as their loyalty and
effort have ignited my days for years &mdash; if it wasn&rsquo;t for what
my teammates have been putting in day in and day out, I don&rsquo;t think
I could have lasted this long.</p>

<p>Among all of the positive qualities that this tech team developed,
there&rsquo;s one I want to call out: the <strong>generosity</strong> that is embedded in this team&rsquo;s
DNA is what is going to make me proud for years to come, as how much
each and every individual strives to help their teammates is something
I haven&rsquo;t experienced before. I am truly happy to say that
we are a team of great software engineers but, way before that,
great human beings.</p>

<p>As for myself, I will take a break, and focus on the next crazy ride
right after. I&rsquo;m not planning to get back to work for at least another couple
of months, and I haven&rsquo;t finalized anything yet. What I can say, though,
is that I&rsquo;m not planning to sit down and discuss new opportunities as I&rsquo;ve
already done that and have shortlisted my options. I&rsquo;m excited about this
ambiguity and, more importantly, I&rsquo;m excited about spending my next
couple of months relaxing, recharging my batteries and waiting to see
the future unfold in front of me.</p>

<p>Bye folks, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>

I was extremely pleased to share some of our ideas / pillars with the

<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;re currently <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2016/08/07/currently-hiring-a-devops-engineer-and-a-js-hacker-here-in-dubai/">looking for a Sr. DevOps engineer and a Sr. JavaScript engineer</a>
here at <a href="https://www.namshi.com">Namshi</a>: the package is attractive and the
learning experience is, in my opinion, well-worth it.</p>

<p>From a DevOps perspective, we work a lot with Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack, Terraform,
Golang and Python &mdash; and everything we run is on AWS.
As a JS engineer instead, expect to be working on SPAs with Angular or React. And a bit of isomorphic JavaScript never
hurts, as well as the ability to dive into the backend with NodeJS.
With 50+ microservices, there&rsquo;s always a chance to learn and experiment over here :)</p>

<p>If you are interested, or happen to know anyone<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> feel free to get in touch with me, or drop
a line to <code>work-in-tech@namshi.com</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I celebrate my third birthday at Namshi, 3 long, long
years that represent an amazing journey in my life.</p>

<p>There are so many moments I will remember forever, many positive ones,
few negative ones, a lot of excitement and huge growth, both
from a personal and professional perspective. There are very
few things I regret and I&rsquo;m honestly proud of that.</p>

<p>There is one big <strong>thank you</strong> that goes to the people in our
team<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. These guys, their
passion, willingness and fighting spirit are what makes the
tech room a sweet home for me.</p>

<p>Instead of mentioning these crazy freaks, I&rsquo;d like to look
back at the moments we spent together, wishing everone
to spend more time with each other in the years to come.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[7 Reasons Why Working for Namshi Is Great]]></title>
    <link href="https://odino.org/7-reasons-why-working-at-namshi-is-great/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-17T17:44:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://odino.org/7-reasons-why-working-at-namshi-is-great</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been working for <a href="http://namshi.com">Namshi</a> for almost 2
years now and I thought it would be interesting to share some
of the reasons why I consider this an ideal place, at the moment.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Some of these points can be extended to the company in general,
while some of them are related to the <a href="http://tech.namshi.com">tech department</a>.
All in all I&rsquo;d like to share my experience and what I feel when
I enter (sometimes late) in the office.</p>

<h2>Young and talented people</h2>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/11924599125_b40b12de0d_n.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/11924599125_b40b12de0d_n.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Here I might repeat what you might have heard on the internet
about <a href="http://www.rocket-internet.de/ventures">Rocket Internet and its ventures</a>,
but working for one of them will make you cross paths with some
of the brightest youngsters across the industry.</p>

<p>If I were to mention everyone, the list would be too long to
fit in this post (and it would grow, like us, as they days go by)
but by walking around the office you can immediately feel
how <strong>many young people are pushing themselves to the max</strong> in
order to make the business as succesfull as possible.</p>

<p>I happen to live with my colleague
<a href="http://ae.linkedin.com/in/casuccioalex">Alessandro</a>,
a <a href="http://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/">Bocconi</a>
graduate from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapani">Trapani</a>,
who has worked for other Rocket ventures in Australia
before landing here in Dubai: see, the amount of work he puts on,
the sleepless nights trying to improve workflows and metrics,
the fervent passion he shows (and the fun as well) on a daily basis
are very difficult to find elsewhere: it takes the right mix
of professionality and age, and I think Namshi makes it
exciting as people come to work to improve, learn and teach,
not (just) for their wage.</p>

<h2>Less talk, more action</h2>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/11924594475_e884e51973.jpg">http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/11924594475_e884e51973.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>As Elvis sang<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>, <strong>a little less conversation,
a little more action</strong>: holy words!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re at a place where we don&rsquo;t rely too much on papers
but proactively experiment solutions (more on this later)
and reward those who make giant leaps with their actions.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that we don&rsquo;t look <strong>too</strong> much at
experience if people have really the skills to become game changers
in the organization: I&rsquo;ve witnessed people without previous
experiences in teams becoming leaders among their peers.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>it&rsquo;s not your job title that defines your boundaries</strong>:
in the tech team, we&rsquo;ve had our most junior member writing and deploying
a NodeJS app in production with Capistrano<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Quoting <a href="ae.linkedin.com/in/sonjaneuber">Sonja</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>[it matters] that people are really driven, that they are passionate about what they do; it doesn&rsquo;t matter that much how long they have worked in their jobs before, 15 years, 5 years, as long as they bring the right attitude and the right spirit on board</p><footer><strong>Sonja</strong> <cite>VP &ndash; Digital Marketing <a href="http://youtu.be/NThxiu1HGgM?t=3m1s">http://youtu.be/NThxiu1HGgM?t=3m1s</a> Working at Namshi</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<h2>MEMEs</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/meme-odino.jpg"></p>

<p>A modern startup cannot live without memes, it&rsquo;s phisically impossible:
here on the right you will find the one our team made for me,
to highlight my nature of late-night coder.</p>

<p>I find it amazing that we can gather together a bunch
of highly-skilled professional to build a dream and having
fun at the same time; having worked for other companies before
I can really say <strong>Namshi has the environment I enjoyed the most</strong>
so far.</p>

<h2>The family built by HR</h2>

<p>I must admit that HR played a <strong>huge role</strong> in making
Namshi an environment that gets better day after day:
the weekly internal newsletter, the
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/106891956@N06/sets/72157637043616496/">Namshi Olimpics</a>,
the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/106891956@N06/sets/72157637897125985/">picnics</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>I never had the privilege to see these in any company
I&rsquo;ve worked for before<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Technology stack</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re a team of polyglots, as our SOA features 4 or 5 different
programming languages and we&rsquo;ve been using pretty interesting
systems over the past 2 years.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve started with refactoring a traditional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier</a>
architecture in order to be able to move towards a
Service Oriented Architecture while keeping up &amp; running
the existing services: the first steps were made with
Symfony2, and now we&rsquo;ve been throwing AngularJS and NodeJS
into the mix, while replacing memcache with Redis in order
to take advantage of a <strong>more structured key-value NoSQL
storage</strong>.</p>

<p>Things don&rsquo;t end on the <em>development</em> side: from the system point of you
we&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a> after a year of
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> and are currently experimenting with
some tailor-made solutions for content delivery.</p>

<p>All in all, I must admit it feels damn exciting :)</p>

<h2>Ability to experiment</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/angularjs.png"></p>

<p>If you paid attention to the previous section, you have probably
noticed that we <strong>transitioned</strong> from an already decoupled architecture
(separate frontend and backend), which means that we had the
chance to experiment a lot in order to completely revamp it:
in the last 12 months we&rsquo;ve started using (for some of us
it was the first time ever) Symfony2, Redis, Lua, xDomain,
AngularJS, Grunt, HTTP extensions and JWS, not to mention the
traditional components of our stack, like RabbitMQ or Solr.</p>

<p>On top of this, we are now hungry for SPDY, WebP
and <strong>API orchestration layers</strong>.
More on this soon on this blog ;&ndash;)</p>

<h2>A great team of nerds</h2>

<p>I will never get bored of repeating this: the tech team, which
I&rsquo;m part of, <strong>feels like a family</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some of us doing their first <code>composer.phar install</code>,
some saying &ldquo;<em>How do I f</em><em>**** get out of this?</em>&rdquo; after
opening VIM, some others reviewing my pull requests like a boss,
and others never hesitating to help a friend who
had his Vagrant machine stuck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the team growing into a squad able to deliver
enterprise applications under the motto
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/14/4621378/the-facebook-ification-of-instagram-begins-today">move fast and break things</a>&rdquo;,
spending endless nights trying to fix PHPUnit tests or
rewriting a service in order to provide a robust checkout
experience written in JavaScript (JS, funky JS!).</p>

<p>Being part of this means recognizing that it will be very
difficult to replicate such achievements elsewhere,
something I will always be proud of.</p>

<h2>So?</h2>

<p>So yes, it feels good to be part of the Namshi family, and since
we have some <a href="/if-you-love-angularjs-you-should-definitely-join-us-dot-dot-dot-were-hiring/">open positions</a>
I would highly recommend you to give us a try :) Of course,
the world offers a lot of interesting and attractive
opportunities, but for the moment I must admit I still feel
<strong>very</strong> lucky.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I have to thank <a href="http://ae.linkedin.com/in/hosam">Hosam</a>,
<a href="http://ae.linkedin.com/in/farazkhalid">Faraz</a><sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> and
<a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/hzarka">Hisham</a> for leading the
crazy family we enjoy on a daily basis!</p>
