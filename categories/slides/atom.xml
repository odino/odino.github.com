opportunity to share some insights on how we run our business with such a small
tech team.</p>

<p>Given <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/078ea8d2-809a-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4">recent news</a>,
I was extremely pleased to share some of our ideas / pillars with the
Rocket-verse (and you as well):</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, part of the
<a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team">Namshi team</a>
attended the 2015 <a href="http://www.techsummit2015.com/">Rocket Tech Summit</a>
in Berlin, a 2-days event that brought together
rocketers from <a href="https://www.rocket-internet.com/companies">all over the world</a>:
the event was focused on knowledge sharing among many
of the ventures that have been launched by
<a href="https://www.rocket-internet.com/">Rocket</a>, but we also
got the chance to hear some kick-ass presentations from
industry leaders like Amazon, Google and ThoughtWorks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelgruber">Manuel</a>
and I had a couple slots to share how we handle a few
things at Namshi (his presentation was more focused
on how we do mobile) and I&rsquo;m happy to share, as usual,
the slides here: my presentation was mostly dealing
with how we try to build the architecture in order to be
confident enough to change, deploy and evolve the
software without getting tangled in those typical
problems (read: slowness) that bigger companies
usually face.</p>
