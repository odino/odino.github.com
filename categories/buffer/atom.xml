<p>This was a funny one! After weeks thinking the Chrome team might have messed up,
I finally got frustrated and looked for a solution to one of the weirdest problems
I had encountered: the DevTool&rsquo;s console getting cleared unexpectedly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I use the console on a daily basis to be able to debug applications,
so it was fairly annoying to see the logs being wiped out unless I ticked the
&ldquo;<em>Preserve log</em>&rdquo; checkbox &mdash; an error would occur, I would open the console only
to find it blank. To make the matter worse, if I&rsquo;d try to reload the page, I could
see the error blink on the console for a fraction of a second, only for it to be
cleared under mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p>Eventually, after a few weeks of enabling &ldquo;<em>Preserve log</em>&rdquo;, I bumped into <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/NIdgxE4UnGQ">this
thread on Chrome&rsquo;s forum</a>
and realized I had Buffer installed as well: turning off the extension magically
gave me my console back. Don&rsquo;t ask why, don&rsquo;t ask how &mdash; all that matters to me
is that I got my DevTools back :)</p>

<p>Adios!</p>
