    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I got to the office and noticed something
peculiar: my XPS' battery had around 7 remaining hours
of life, while until the week earlier I had never seen it above 3 hours.</p>

<p>This is the (very short) story of how I supercharged my
laptop&rsquo;s battery without even knowing how to.</p>

<h2>A bit of background</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/laptop-charge-1.png"></p>

<p>Last month I flew to the most beautiful continent in
the world with the idea of spending a whole week doing safaris in
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=serengeti&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW9JXVqf_eAhWJ_lQKHYGgCYsQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=990">Tanzania&rsquo;s national parks</a>.</p>

<p>Suffice to say I wasn&rsquo;t super excited about bringing
my laptop with me, mainly because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d be on a jeep the whole time, and carrying it with me would
make no sense, since I&rsquo;d just put it under a lot of stress</li>
<li>I spent most of my nights at a camp that did not have any
internet access at all, so good luck getting online regardless</li>
</ul>


<p>Eventually, I decided to leave the laptop at home, something
I hadn&rsquo;t done since a few years. Gone for a good week&hellip;</p>

<p>Once I got home, I noticed something interesting:
the light that signals the battery level is low was blinking &mdash;
&ldquo;probably got drained over the week&rdquo;, I thought.</p>

<p>Plugged in my charger, waited until the laptop was fully
charged, then the miracle happened: since then,
the battery life has been extended by &frac34; hours at least
(you might think that&rsquo;s not crazy, but for a battery that
used to give me &frac34; hours of love at most, being able to do 6/8 hours
in a row is a blessing).</p>

<h2>How did this happen?</h2>

<p>Frankly, I do not know. I&rsquo;ve always been a big believer of letting the
battery work &ldquo;at full capacity&rdquo;, meaning that I let it drain as much as
possible before charging it until it&rsquo;s completely full.</p>

<p>I think this week-long draining session, without small charges
in between, has allowed the battery to calibrate (?) better,
or <em>god-knows-what</em>. Right now, being left with 20% of battery
means I can still go on for a couple of hours:</p>

<p>All I know is that I have a better battery<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>, and I owe it to
going on a vacation and being able to &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo;. Probably, the underlying lesson is that it&rsquo;s good to disconnect once a year :)</p>

<p>Adios!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my last vacation I had some troubles
making my <a href="http://gopro.com/">GoPro</a> visible
to Ubuntu through the USB charger so I decided
to go for a different approach.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Turns out that the camera itself exposes an HTTP
server, which lists the contents of the camera, at
<a href="http://10.5.5.9:8080">10.5.5.9:8080</a>, so after
turning on the WiFi hotspot on the camera and
connecting my laptop to it I just needed to:</p>

<p><code>
wget -r http://10.5.5.9:8080/
</code></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unlucio">Lucio</a>
for suggesting the <code>-r</code>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, even though I come from a weekend
of barely sleeping, I decided, after an entire
day unable to connect to the WiFi of the office,
to try to fix this issue that seems to be affecting
the Dell XPS harder than other laptops.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>After googling for a while and realizing that
even at home I got no luck with my wireless,
I decided to go on with my own usual solution,
which means <strong>downgrading the kernel or grub</strong>.</p>

<p>You can get a list of the <em>installables</em> from
any terminal:</p>

<p><code>
 dpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'"$(uname -r | sed "s/\(.*\)-\([^0-9]\+\)/\1/")"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \([^ ]*\).*/\1/;/[0-9]/!d'
</code></p>

<p>And since I&rsquo;m currently using <code>3.8.0-27-generic</code>
I decided to give a slightly previous one a try;
let&rsquo;s edit grub:</p>

<p><code>
sudo /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub 3.8.0-19-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-19-generic
</code></p>

<p>This solved the issue, at least for me ;&ndash;)</p>
