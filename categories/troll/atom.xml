    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but, for me, since I got VP / CXO in my designation the
amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_email">cold emails</a> I receive from salespeople at random companies has spiked
up quite substantially &mdash; every day I need to go through countless of &ldquo;<em>Just the
right thing to start the week</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Alex, you will not regret this</em>&rdquo;, which is
quite annoying to say the least.</p>

<p>Fair game, though, as I can filter most of them out through amazing tools like
<a href="https://www.sanebox.com/">SaneBox</a>. But this week I received one of those
emails that are plain scam, blatantly unethical, and I wanted to share my
experience with you because, yes, I didn&rsquo;t let this one go unnoticed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>It all started with&hellip;</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/gcc.png"></p>

<p>Background: I&rsquo;m the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandronadalin/">CTO</a> of <a href="https://en-ae.namshi.com/">Namshi</a>, the biggest fashion-focused online retailer
in the Middle East. We operate across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council">GCC</a>
(so we&rsquo;re pretty tied down to the area over here) and do not have any physical store
because, well, e-commerce. Duh.</p>

<p>So you can imagine the surprise when I received an email with a subject that
sounded too friendly to be true:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales0.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;and I&rsquo;m like wow, this person&rsquo;s girlfriend must have shopped from us &mdash; maybe
while on vacation, maybe they actually live down here. So I must admit I got a
little bit curious and decided to check if he had some interesting feedback about
their shopping experience. I opened the email and:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales1.png"></p>

<p>Now, again, let&rsquo;s focus on the first paragraph:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales2.png"></p>

<p>and pretend for a second that you&rsquo;re me, trying to find Oxford Street on this
map:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales3.png"></p>

<p>This is a portion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah">Jeddah, KSA</a> and yes,
I&rsquo;m just screwing around. Since I&rsquo;m in the mood, let&rsquo;s have some fun while at it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales4.png"></p>

<p>Alex, what a surprise, you&rsquo;re in the UK!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales5.png"></p>

<p>What a coincidence, we&rsquo;re both on Oxford Street! (in hindsight, that &ldquo;<em>our office is <strong>actually</strong> in Oxford Street</em>&rdquo; sounds too
funny)</p>

<p>Anyhow, you know me, I&rsquo;m so attached to work that I don&rsquo;t want to waste time in the
trip:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales6.png"></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s just confirm the address:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales7.png"></p>

<p>You know what?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales8.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;and you think that&rsquo;s it, he or she must have realized I was just screwing
around and this is just a good laugh for me. Surprisingly, I <strong>still</strong> get
a reply back because, hey, a true salesman never gives up:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/sales9.png"></p>

<h2>People, this is not cool.</h2>

<p>This has to stop &mdash; it&rsquo;s beyond annoying, beyond the follow-up emails, beyond
the distracting subjects: it&rsquo;s simply <strong>unethical</strong>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re lying to create a connection with a potential client, and I&rsquo;m sure as hell
we would never do business with individuals (or companies) that employ such
sneaky tactics. I&rsquo;ve been pondering whether I should reveal the identity behind
those emails, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s holiday season so Santa told me
to let this one go.</p>

<p>Look, I understand the job&rsquo;s not easy, you have targets to hit and the pressure&rsquo;s
on, but if you cant be straight and get a client I don&rsquo;t know what makes you think
you&rsquo;re better of lying and being sneaky.</p>

<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s a lot of fun material around the web regarding these
