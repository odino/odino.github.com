    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As announced on twitter a few days back, it seems
that the time has come for me to step up and start
dealing with printed paper.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve never talked about,
and especially in the last 9 months I wanted
to start something towards this direction &ndash;
my draft of
<a href="https://leanpub.com/rest-webservices-php">REST webservices in PHP</a>
is still there ideed.</p>

<p>At the same time, even though self-publishing
is easier and provides good motivation at first,
<strong>is not very attractive on the long run</strong>,
for both the author and the reader: yes, you
get to reach a wide audience, yes, they can
learn in a really cheap way<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>,
but writing a <strong>real</strong> book is way different.
It&rsquo;s a statement, a printed statement: it is
<strong>just different</strong>.</p>

<p>The chance has come quite quickly, as I will be
<strong>co-author</strong> of a book by
<a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Publications Co.</a>,
which is a very important editor when it comes to
the language with the J.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange? I am a seasoned lead developer
on the LAMP stack but I will write a book dealing with a tool
that has something to do with Java: there a reason,
of course, behind this.</p>

<p>And probably you have already guessed it.</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>Our challenge is to evangelize this new frontier for
data storage: I&rsquo;m sure it will be a long but succesfull
way.</p>

		<li id='fn:1'>Usually cheap: some books on LeanPub were even sold for 50 USD <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li><li id='fn:2'>I could write a separate chapter on Luca. Let&rsquo;s just say that meeting him gave me the confidence that even without a college degree you can be a game-changer in your field. <a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li>
